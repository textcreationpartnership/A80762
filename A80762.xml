         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of Patronage where it defends the Truth in the Truth: of Correction where it halteth into the defence of error in ſteed of the Truth, or of the Truth but not in the Truth. The work it ſelf will ſufficiently ſpeak me out not fit to be regiſtred <hi>inter Doctos,</hi> yet hath it been ſtill my ſtudy not to commit any thing by which I ſhould deſerve to be pronounced <hi>indocilis,</hi> untractable to learn where the
<pb facs="tcp:167891:4"/> Lord holds forth a faithfull Teacher. It is the height of my ambition and patheticall heartineſs of my humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, not ſo much to all of you Collectively (which is unattainable) as to every of you diviſively, who in theſe ſlippery times (Honored Worthies) ſtand faſt in the truth of Chriſt, to be recalled by you into the way from which you ſhall finde me any where ſtraying: but ſo that by the Authority of the Word you lead me into it, that I may gladly be a follower of ſuch a leader. As to the Book to which this anſwereth, whatſoever Fate this ſhall have in mens judgements, ſurely that muſt have a ſtinch with all the judicious and orthodox. Neither could it ſo long have ſtood unſhaken, had he not cunningly prepoſſeſſed the minds of his Readers with Affection and prejudice, the two worſt Clouds which oft bemiſt the judgement of them that are both pious and prudent, that in ſeeing they do not, becauſe they would not perceive the truth for a ſeaſon. The Affections of many he attracted to himſelf by profeſſing himſelf a zealous Presbyterian. This pretext made not a few to look over and beyond his Contagious doctrine, to behold and regard the perſon of the man for his unanimity with them in diſcipline. This vizzard is at length ſo faln from his Face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the moſt do and all may ſee him under this profeſſion, to have been but as the Anabaptized Jeſuit, taking his ſtation there from whence he thought to have moſt advantage to promote his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh doctrines, Concluding that under that name his Fraud would not be ſo eaſily eſpyed. And is there now any which ſeeth not he would be Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independent, for any Government, for no Government, helping him to drive home to the head his ſoul-ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines into the hearts of men? Prejudice againſt the ſacred Truth which he oppugneth, he fomented by aſperſing the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Chriſt with the black brand of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonianiſm,
<pb facs="tcp:167891:4"/> reſerving onely the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> whom he followeth, free of it. How much he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in ſowring with the leaven of Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees which is hypocriſie, the vulgar ſort not onely of the people, but of the Miniſters alſo, with this groſs impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, would be incredible, if experience did not manifeſt it. Therefore finding this Feat ſo ſoveraign to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ends, aſſoon as he heard of exceptions in the Preſs againſt his Aphoriſms, his firſt indeavours have been to fill with prejudice the minds of men againſt the both work and Author thereof, diſperſing thorow this Citty by his Printer that it is the Hant-ſhire Antinomian that excepteth ſo againſt him. How irrational and malicious this his inditement againſt me is, may appear hence, that I dwell in one of the obſcureſt nooks of this Engliſh little world, ſo unknown as he is famous, that he could not ſo much as hear of my name, ſaving by ſome one of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumforaneous Legates (which having their Provinces aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned either of one or more Counties, are ſtill Circling and Compaſſing them, firſt to diſperſe this his Myſtery of iniquity with ſuch accurateneſs, that there may be no one that hath the repute of a pious Gentleman or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a ſtranger to it; and then by their frequent viſitations to examine how the Baxterian Faith thrives in each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to hold them fixed to it) Theſe returning once in ſix or ſeven Moneths out of their Circuits to their Grand Maſter may poſſibly ſpeak in things which they know not, what they think may be plauſible to him. It hath not been unknown (I acknowledge) to ſome of theſe that I diſreliſhed his doctrine, and did hinder the embracing of it: But might not this my diſſenting be as properly termed Treaſon as Antinonianiſm?</p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe I underſtand that theſe ſparkes of falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fire have no ſooner faln than taken in ſome, I am forced to Apologize ſomewhat (and that with the more Confidence
<pb facs="tcp:167891:5"/> becauſe to you that have the eyes of your underſtanding moſt clear rightly to Cenſure or judge) that prejudice may be no hinderance to the truth. What I ſhall ſpeak herein muſt relate partly to my ſelf, partly to Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> and partly to the doctrine it ſelf which he hath drawn into Controverſie Condemning it of Antinomiſm.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What I ſhall ſpeak of my ſelf ſhall not be with an heart and a heart, the one open to let out what it liſteth, the other reſerved to retein in ſecrecy what is not for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the ends ſought after: but in plainneſs and ſimplicity I ſhall deliver the whole and naked truth of my judgement as before the Lord my Judge and Juſtifier. Neither is there need of hiding and Tergiverſation, <hi>for I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt: It is the power of God to ſalvation</hi> &amp;c. And as ſweet to me as the ſalvation which it bringeth. I therefore profeſs my ſelf clear from all that is rightly Called, and hath been judged by the reformed Churches and their Champions Antinonianiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiteneſs to the Law. Theſe things I acknowledg my ſelf to hold and teach: 1 That Beleevers are not under the Curſe of the Law as the Curſe. 2 Nor are the Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which befall them ſo the Curſe of the Law, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging puniſhments for ſinn, but the fruits of the tender Love of a good and provident Father working for good to them. 3 That they are not under the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works. If theſe things be Antinoniſm I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my ſelf an Antinomian: yet ſuch as onely the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs madneſs and malice of men poſſibly may account ſo, but that I have the Apoſtles and all the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Writers (without any exception) under the ſame aſperſion with me, having all ſtoutly maintained all theſe as Goſpel-truths againſt the falſe Apoſtles, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Arminians, in their ſeverall generations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Contradiction of any except Papiſts and Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to whom Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> not without ſome fellowes, hath
<pb facs="tcp:167891:5"/> lately Apoſtatized. 4 Yet I ſtill grant the preaching of the Law, and that in its full perfection and all its terrors, uſefull to ſhake in pieces all the carnall Confidences and ſelf righteouſneſs of man, that deſpairing of ſafety in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he may be forced to ſeek it out of himſelf from meer Mercy, in another which is Chriſt the Saviour. 5. That the Law is ſtill a perfect rule and directive of all morall righteouſneſs and obedience both to beleevers and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, ſo that in both all variation from it is ſinn, but Conformity to it is regularity and obedience. In reſpect of my judgement therefore about the Law, I queſtion not my diſcharge from the imputation of Antinomiſm among the truly wiſe and orthodox, except to be a Chriſtian be Antinonianiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As to Mr. <hi>Br,</hi> it is evident that he aſperſeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent with the Fault whereof himſelf is guilty. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Chriſt to require under the Goſpel, the perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs which the Law commandeth, and Conſequently that it is not either our duty to perform it, or our ſinn to fail in it, or that the Law is an adequate and Competent rule of morall obedience, Becauſe it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands more than it is our duty to perform. He ſaith not Chriſt requires it not in order to this end, but ſimply and abſolutely he requires it not. If this be not Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part. 1. p.</hi> 213. &amp;c.</note> then <hi>Iſlebius</hi> himſelf hath been unjuſtly Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 As to the matter yet remaining Charged by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> and others with Antinomianiſm, it may be reduced prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to four heads. 1 Juſtification as an Immanent Act in God; As actually Completed in the redemption which is by Chriſt &amp; in Chriſt; (both theſe before we beleeve:) 3 The abſoluteneſs and irreſpectiveneſs of it, freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conditions: 4 Chriſts ſatisfying for mans ſinns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel as well as againſt the Law. Though I have ſpoken of all theſe enough, of each in its proper
<pb facs="tcp:167891:6"/> place within this Tractate, yet ſomewhat for the fuller Clearing of my meaning may be ſaid here alſo. The firſt and ſecond I ſhall for brevity join in one as of no ſmall Cognation. As farr as I hold and have declared my ſelf to hold them; 1 I have alſo manifeſted in due place, how they are or ſeem at leaſt to be grounded upon the Scriptures; 2 They are expreſly and boldly aſſerted by many of the moſt Conſpicuous Divines in piety and Learning, that any of the Proteſtant Churches have enjoyed ever ſince the Reformation. 3. And that without the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exception of any Church or Orthodox Writer for well nigh a hundred yeares, made againſt it: A great and probable Argument that it was the Common Judgement of all the Churches. 4. Mr. <hi>Rhaeterfordt</hi> in his <hi>Exercit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog.</hi> holds it forth not as the private opinion of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, but as the Common Judgement of all the Churches. And the Remonſtrants take it as ſuch: For ſo I remember they oft argue in their <hi>Apol.</hi> and elſwhere, <hi>Juſtificatio eſt purus putus Actus in Deo immanens</hi> &amp;c. not that they expreſs what <hi>Arminius</hi> his judgment and theirs after him is in this point: but that from this as a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they knew common to, and would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by any Proteſtant, their Argument would ſtand firm againſt them. Neither know I any one of the Proteſtants that hath written againſt them, excepting againſt it. 5 I never read any (to make me diſſent in judgement from theſe Worthies) that hath given his reaſons againſt it ſave Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> alone: and he handles the queſtion, like a man <hi>ſpoyled with Philoſophy and vain deceit</hi> (as the Apoſtle ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the uſe of exotick learning in purely Goſpel mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) <hi>after the traditions of men and Rudiments of the world, not after Chriſt;</hi> Col. 2. 8. And his nakedneſs in ſuch his arguing is enough diſcovered by a learned Writer whoſe worth I ſhall ſtill honour, but have not ſo much as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ever to match. <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</hi>
                     </note> He tells us indeed that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:167891:6"/> hath written againſt it as delivered by Mr. <hi>Pemble.</hi> But I could not get the book to ſee his reaſons, nor know I any thing which he hath written but as I have heard from others. Beſides I have been told that ſome of the late Reverend Synod, diſreliſhed the doctrine, but cannot finde that any one of them hath publiſhed his reaſons for ſuch a diſreliſh. And Charity will not permit me to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the lighteſt imagination that any of thoſe grave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines culld and ſelected out of the whole Nation for their eminency in godlineſs and learning, ſhould without any means uſed for information and conviction, exerciſe a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over the Conſciences of their leſſer brethren to force them into an implicit Faith to beleeve as themſelves beleeve: ſpecially when doing it they ſhall put out that which they think at leaſt to be the light of the word in their conſcience, and in conſenting with them without hearing a reaſon, they ſhall diſſent from others (whom their Modeſty will confeſs to be of no leſs deſervings in the Church) who have given their reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill I hold, 1 that thoſe Scriptures which treat of Juſtification by Faith do all relate to the tranſient juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which no man partakes of till he beleeveth. 2 That no man is perſonally juſtified, but onely in Chriſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon, till he be by Faith united to Chriſt. That righteouſneſs and life ſo diſcend to us from the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as ſinn and condemnation from the firſt. <hi>As by the offence of one judgement came upon all to condemnation: ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one</hi> the free gift <hi>came upon all to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19. In <hi>Adam</hi> the publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we were all repreſented, he was all, and we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in him, God ſaw us in all our individuall perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns in him, though we through <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw it not: ſo that <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>am</hi> ſinning we all ſinned in him and became dead in law and guilty of condemnation before God, as if we had been then being and actually ſinning. Nevertheleſs as to our
<pb facs="tcp:167891:7"/> ſelves we were not perſonally ſinners and guilty, untill we had a perſonall being in and from <hi>Adam.</hi> So in Chriſt ſatisfying Gods juſtce for ſinn, the Elect were all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as in a publike perſon, ſatisfying in him &amp; by him, and ſo all in him and by him juſtified and abſolved in all their individualls from ſinn and condemnation before God: Nevertheleſs we are not perſonally ſo juſtified, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we have a perſonall being and new being in Chriſt and from Chriſt. 3. That this Tranſient Juſtification is a juſtifying or being juſtified before God paſſed at Gods Tribunall ſet up in mans Conſcience, from which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth abſolution to a poore ſinner denying himſelf and reſting upon Chriſt alone for Mercy. So that now, and never untill now he hath boldneſs to pierce by Faith into the Holieſt, and plead his righteouſneſs before him that ſitteth on the Mercy-ſeat. Thus our juſtification which was before in God and in Chriſt, is not at all derogatory to the juſtification which is by Faith: but onely prevents that this latter may not be derogatory to the praiſe of Gods Grace and Chriſts merits, which have completed all without our ſubſerviency for us: and thus God is all, ſeen to be all, and our boaſting excluded. This hitherto is my judgement untill I ſhall be better inſtructed—<hi>Tu ſi quid noviſti rectius iſtis, Candidus imperti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And at length if it ſhall be granted to be an error, yet it cannot be Antinomiſm, being a deviation not from the doctrine of the Law but of the Goſpel. It was not the judgement but malice of Mr. <hi>Br</hi> that gave it this brand of ignominy.</p>
                  <p>3 To the free abſolute and unconditionall Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I need not to Apologize for my ſelf at all. It is to the truly pious of the Miniſtery to whom my words are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, who (among other) have given this evidence of your godlineſſe, that ye have not <hi>forſaken your first Faith</hi> by declining to Popery or Arminianiſm, what others
<pb facs="tcp:167891:7"/> judge of me is <hi>to me a ſmall thing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle of ſuch) I weigh it not. But ye no doubt teach that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promulgation of Juſtification runs upon no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but Faith alone, and upon Faith, not as a quality or vertue, but inſtrumentall to apply the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to Juſtification, that works and the univerſall conditionall Juſtification which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath learned of his Maſters, are to be excluded. In this your doctrine is one and the ſame in ſenſe and ſubſtance with theirs that affirm Juſtification to be unconditionall. And it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to me to deliver the ſame truth in their words or yours: Onely I find that they make uſe of both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and this Concluſion, as ſtrong Fortreſſes againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Arminianiſm, which cauſeth Mr. Br. with ſo much impetuouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe and impotency to uſe his Mounts and Mines againſt them. Neither can I ſee any ground of objecting that either of theſe two doctrines can in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect dull the affections to good works, ſith it is confeſſed that they have no co-officiating with Faith to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 To Chriſts ſatisfying for ſins againſt the Goſpel as wel as againſt the Law, I doubt not but ye ſee both the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and falſity of Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> Negation thereof. The chief Doctrines of the Goſpel are Grace and Gratitude, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification. If Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for our long unbelief and contempt of the word of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we beleeve, and of the infirmities of our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Thankfulneſſ when we have beleeved; or that there are ſins againſt the New which are not ſins againſt the Old Teſtament alſo; or that the Lord Jeſus is not the Mediator of the New Teſtament but of the Old onely; or that in any of theſe it ſhould be Antinomianiſm to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Mr. <hi>Br:</hi> Theſe all are ſo groſſe Paradoxes that your gravity and wiſedom cannot without Nauſeouſneſſ ſmell them: plainly enough declaring indeed that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:167891:8"/> ſtandeth in his way of Babel building he will curſe it (though never ſo ſacred) and fright them that are as feeble as fearfull, with his ſcar crow of Antinomianiſm, though he make himſelf never ſo ridiculous thereby to the intelligent and prudent.</p>
                  <p>I have no more to ſay upon this ſubject, and what I have ſaid hath been before him that being omniſcient knoweth that I have ſpoken ſingly the whole truth, and nothing but the Truth. Neither can all the ſtrength of my jealouſy ſuſpect any leaſt or greateſt thing beſides theſe wherewith either Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> or any of his Diſciples c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n charge me as with Antinomianiſm, ſo that I do with ſome confident boldneſſe appeal to your judgment whether I deſerve from them this imputation. Inded ſuch ſoul-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving comforts have flown in upon me from the Grace of God in Chriſt, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will ſpeak, and I can ſcarce Preach any other thing then Chriſt and him Crucified; yet in holding forth a wounded, I hold not forth a maimed Chriſt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Chriſt with all his benefits, in particular to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification no leſſe then to Juſtification. If it be Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm ſo to reduce all to Chriſt, and derive all from him, I muſt undergo the worlds condemnation for Chriſts ſake that hath juſtified and will at length receive me.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I have to add, and I ſhall be no further tedious. It may be a Charge againſt me that I am too plain, broad and unſparing in my words againſt Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> throughout this Tractate. That which I have to ſay for my ſelf is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That it ariſeth not ſo much from my own temper, as from the occaſion thereof given by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> I am ready for Chriſts ſake to become the footſtool of the meek, but where I find a ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exalting, I cannot cry <hi>Abreoh.</hi> When I ſee Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> uſurping the Chair to paſſe ſentence and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon all the Divines that have written, theſe are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:167891:8"/> thoſe unſtudied Divines, to exalt and degrade better men than himſelf as they are more either concurrent with or abhorrent from his <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Arminius:</hi> I cannot, I dare not uſe words that might ſtrengthen but rather vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confidence and arrogance of the man. So when the Wolf comes in ſheeps clothing to devour, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the profeſſion of a Proteſtant and Preſbyterian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, he vends his Popiſh and Arminian under the name of Proteſtant Tenets, diſſembling his confederacy with the enemies thereof,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou knoweſt me as well as I know my ſelfe, thou wilt alſo wonder as much as my ſelf, to ſee me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in Print, ſpecially in ſo Momentous a Cauſe, and that againſt ſo formidable an Antagoniſt. But the ground of our wondering may ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. That which affects thee may be, that a man of ſo deſpicable parts ſhould dare to brandiſh a weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though the Lords) againſt ſo great &amp; incomparable a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, as fleſh and blood accounts him. But the thing which affects me is, that the Heroick Worthies of our Land hide their heads, and <hi>Come not forth to helpe the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> Jud. 5. 23, but leave the defence of Chriſts cauſe to contemptible and unqualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſuch a performance. In excuſe of my ſelfe againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of raſhneſſe and preſumption, I can ſay, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms had been extant full three yeares, before I put pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to except againſt him. A ſtrong expectation ſtill poſſeſſed me of ſeeing ſomething come forth againſt him from an abler hand. When my expectation failed, and I found his Tractate of all other that have come forth theſe many yeares, moſt perillous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, as deſtroying the very foundation of a Chriſtians hope and
<pb facs="tcp:167891:11"/> comfort, at length I thought it fit to do my endeavour for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving of ſome private Friends either taken, or in danger to be taken in his ſnares, not ceaſing ſtill to expect the publication of ſome work by others, openly to vindicate the grace of God from his injurious warring againſt it. At length, having finiſhed what I thought fit to be communicated privately to ſome friends, and not with-holding the view thereof from any that craved it; I ſuffered it to ſleep many moneths, in hope ſtill to ſee a more learned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his worke. What ſhould I do more? May not I juſtly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> when all the armed Worthies of Iſrael either fled, or at leaſt ſhunned the encounter, was <hi>there not a cauſe to ſtand forth</hi> (for lack of better weapons) <hi>with a ſling and a ſmooth ſtone,</hi> truſting in the name of the God of <hi>Iſrael, whoſe grace this man had defied?</hi> When the wiſe and prudent, the high Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees oppugned the grace of God in giving Chriſt to be the juſtifier of Publicans, Harlots, and Sinners, the ſpirit of Chriſt enlarged the hearts of the illiterate and vulgar <hi>to ſing their Hoſannahs, and out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings ordained praiſe</hi> to himſelfe: Nay, <hi>if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the very ſtones ſhould cry out,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. When the caſe is like it at preſent, and the <hi>Angelici Doctores</hi> are ſilent, it is the fit ſeaſon for Chriſt to animate the very <hi>Terrae filios,</hi> to ſpeak in the defence of his grace. I held my ſelfe the unfitteſt of many (if not of all) to come upon this ſtage; yet not ſo unfit, but if none elſe would, I tooke my ſelf obliged to aſcend it. Yea ſuch is the power of <hi>Truth,</hi> this <hi>Truth of Truths,</hi> this great and cardinall truth here controverted, that I feare not by the word, and in the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, to enter the Liſts with all men and Devills that ſhall oppugn it; ſo vain a ſhadow is all the wiſdome and ſophiſtry of men, and depths of Satan, when oppoſed to the Goſpel of Chriſt which is the power and wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p>It will next be objected, that this Tractate of mine comes forth into publique view more raw, rugged, incompendious, and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, than befits the Majeſtie of the Doctrine whereof it treateth. I doe not, I cannot deny it. I ſaw what ſhould have been done more, but was not in a capacity to do it. That which I can ſay for my ſelf is, 1. That it was written for private uſe, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſe to make it common, untill I came to the latter part, and almoſt the end of it. 2. My acquaintance knoweth how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and how long interruptions of ſickneſſe I had in the writing thereof, that I was but <hi>Canis ad Nilum,</hi> did all by ſnatches, which
<pb facs="tcp:167891:11"/> much hindered the right compoſure of the whole, and connexion of its parts. 3. I could not find one man about us that <hi>vel prece vel pretio,</hi> was fit and willing to tranſcribe one Copie thereof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in ſtrength of body to do it my ſelfe: So that what was firſt done, in the ſame <hi>Craſſo filo</hi> in which it was firſt done, without any abreviations, alterations, or poliſhings, is now preſented to the Printer to be made uſe of: My judgment telling me that rather a courſe piece, then nothing at all ſhould appear againſt Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> at leaſt to invite others that excell in abilities of minde and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to come after with a more exact Treatiſe. If all this excuſe not, and that the <hi>Velle</hi> be no fit Apology to take off the crime of <hi>Non Poſſe,</hi> I am contented to lie under Cenſure: yet with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the leſſe of man, the more of God is to be found in theſe fruits of my Labours; All that is therein being grounded upon the ſure word of God, whoſe plainneſs hath more excellency in it then all mans accurateneſſe.</p>
                  <p>It remains, that before I diſcend to give my particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Doctrine of this Tractate of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſomething be premiſed. 1. Of the Author, 2. Of the worke in generall, 3. Of my intention in excepting againſt it. The miſtake of the two former more deluding ſome unwary perſons (as I have obſerved) then all his arguments of themſelves could do. 1. Then of the Author.</p>
                  <p>I can ſpeak nothing of him from my owne acquaintance with him. For, <hi>Albus an ater, homo ſit neſcio,</hi> I was never ſo happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to ſee his face, therefore muſt ſpeak of him partly as he hath been repreſented and deſcribed by others, partly as he makes out himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Touching his learning, as he hath been magnified by others, ſuch he manifeſteth himſelfe. He that ſhall peruſe this one Tractate of his, muſt be forced to cry out, <hi>Quantus, quantus, nil niſi ſapientia eſt,</hi> a deep and meer Philoſopher (I ſay not Philoſophaſter) yea <hi>Grammaticus Rhetor Geometres,</hi> &amp;c. In all partt of humane learning a <hi>Cathedrall Doctor:</hi> But his Maſter-piece is <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> in this way of the worlds ſublimated Divinity; he is not behind the Angelicall and Seraphicall Doctors, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and their followers. As for that lower and meaner region of Learning, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture, and more ſpecially Goſpel-knowledg, himſelfe tells us that his <hi>ſtanding and underſtanding</hi> is mounted above that mentioned, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 9. That for lack of other work, and through the defect or abſence
<pb facs="tcp:167891:12"/> of better Books, he once read the Scripture ſix dayes together, in<note place="margin">Append. pag. 110, 111.</note> which time he ſuckt much more out of the Word, then ever God breathed into it, which he confeſſeth he could not have done of himſelfe, without the help of other Books which he had formerly read, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the gloſſes of the Schoolmen and Jeſuites, which know ſo much of Chriſt, as their Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could teach them. And that this man underſtands the Scriptures no leſſe compleatly than the worſt of them in a Catholique ſenſe, we ſhall finde I doubt not, when we come to examine the Texts which he brings to prove his Catholique Juſtification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for his piety, ſtrictneſſe, mortification, holineſſe, zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in reſpect whereof ſome have even canoniz'd him for a matchleſſe and ſuper-eminent Saint (as I have underſtood by many in the Weſtern parts, before I ever ſaw any of his works) I ſhould ſay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in ſaying over what Dr. <hi>Twiſſ.</hi> hath written in his Anſwer to the Preface and Prefacer unto <hi>Arminius</hi> his <hi>Anti-perkinſinianiſm,</hi> where the <hi>Prefacer</hi> in the ſame manner exalteth the parts and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Arminius,</hi> thereby to make way into the hearts of men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Doctrine. The Dr. acquitting himſelfe firſt of any diſlike that he hath of the piety of children in advancing their Fathers praiſe, and affirming his deſire herein to proceed no further then to lay downe a caution, that the truth may receive no damage by the ſuperlative praiſe of any man; anſwers, That although there might be oppoſed againſt <hi>Arminius</hi> that diſſent from him in iudgment, even the whole cloud of Proteſtant Divines, the very lights of the Church, that in parts and vertues were no way behind <hi>Arminius,</hi> if not his ſuperiours; yet he will not do it, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath God commanded, nor is it ſafe for us to make the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of mens perſons, but the infallible word of the moſt High, our rule to judge of Doctrines, and try the opinions of men.</p>
                  <p>But I adde ſecondly, That it hath been uſuall to Satan in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to employ whited Sepulchers, beautifull without, to broach and defend Hereſies in the Church. He wants not his depths, is not ignorant that men of vitious lives are unfit to deceive and pervert conſciences. Therefore when himſelfe will deceive, he puts off his Devils face, and <hi>transforms himſelfe into an Angell of Light: No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile then if he teach his Miniſters,</hi> when they are about to ſeduce, <hi>to transforme themſelves into Apoſtles of Chriſt, and Miniſters of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 13.—15. Where hath there ever been more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of holineſſe (and men cannot ſearch the heart) then in
<pb facs="tcp:167891:12"/> the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees?</hi> Then in the <hi>Monks and Fryers?</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Socinians,</hi> yea among the very <hi>Turkes?</hi> Shall then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward varniſh of their ſeeming vertues, befool us to drink downe their damning doctrines?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Though <hi>Paul or an Angel from Heaven preach unto you another Goſpel, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. ſaith the Holy Ghoſt; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> doth in this Treatiſe bring us another Goſpel, his Doctrine in the Examination thereof will manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I would that this his Treatiſe did ſpeak him out to be ſo ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and tenderly conſcientious as his friends proclaim him; I ſhould then either in perſon have made recourſe to him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my thoughts to him, or written in another tone, in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to him, to have received fuller ſatisfaction from him, if my impotency could not have miniſtred ſome information to him. But we ſhall find in what he writes, many things that may work in us a jealouſie of the ſincerity of a ſanctified Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in him. I ſhall here mention ſome generals, leaving the reſt untill we come to except againſt the particulars.</p>
                  <p>One thing that occaſioneth this jealouſie, is the want of ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, truth and ſimplicity in his Aſſertions. For one inſtance hereof we need not ſtep further then to the title of the work, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it to be publiſhed eſpecially for the uſe of the Church of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire.</hi> Can any man that hath but glanced an eye on the ſurface of humane literature, think him to mean as he ſpeaketh? Either we muſt conclude that he hath the very ſpirit of all Philoſophicall and Metaphyſicall learning, which he breaths forth as effectually upon his Diſciples, as <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> did the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt upon his <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> or elſe his Church for the greateſt number of its members is not in a capacity of underſtanding him. That his Church by his preſidency in it, is on a ſudden become <hi>a Najoth in Ramah,</hi> every <hi>Saul</hi> that comes neer it doth <hi>philoſophari,</hi> if not <hi>prophetare,</hi> ſo that <hi>ex ejus Ludo tanquam ex equo Trojano innumeri principes exiêre (Pauls</hi> Princes, I mean Princes in ſecular wiſedome and learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. 8.) elſe if his people have no ſuch inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration above other Churches, ſurely the moſt of them ſtagger at the firſt word in the title of the Book, underſtand not the tenth part of his ſacred ſubtle diſtinctions, but in moſt things that he ſaith he is to them a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and they to him.

                     <hi>Baxter</hi> is not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he knowes where and for what mouths to chew his morſels, and to whom to give them to be chewed. It was eſpecially for the
<pb facs="tcp:167891:13"/> nimble wits and logicall Teachers of the Churches, that this broth was boyled (as I ſhall ſhew more fully afterward) that having miſled the leaders, he might by them miſlead their flocks alſo. 2 And as little ingenuity and truth is there in him, where he quoteth ſome whom he (againſt his ſtomach) cals Orthodox Divines, and from ſome locutions and fragments of their ſentences, concludes them to be of his Judgement; when he knowes their Doctrine about Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, to be ſo diametrically oppoſite to his, as hell to heaven, and Antichriſt to Chriſt: ſo that if they be Orthodox, himſelfe muſt needs be Hetorodox. This he well knowes, but his ingenuity and ſingle-heartednes hides it, and pretends the contrary. 3 Is not his face Ferry-man-like one way, and his motion another, when the whole tenor of what he writes is not to ſet up any new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to erect again, and put life into that curſed Hereſie of the Papiſts, Juſtification by Works; yet to hide his purpoſe from them that ſee not, or will not ſee, he ſometimes <hi>ſolemnly profeſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that it is no affectation of ſingularity that drew him to this Judgement; at other times falls foul with the Papiſts,</hi> telling us that <hi>no advantage is to be given to the Papiſts in this Doctrine of Juſtification,</hi> when himſelfe all the while is ploughing their field, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening their hands to the offence of all the truly wiſe and godly: what hypocriſie, ſembling and diſſembling is this? Why doth he acquit himſelfe of that which no man chargeth upon him? What underſtanding Reader of him can harbour one thought of his bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſingularity / It is plain to every eye that is open, that he walks not ſolitary, but hath thronged himſelfe into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Holy Mother Church, and fellowſhip of all her Saint Popiſh Schoolmen, Monks, Fryers, and Jeſuites. That his ſtudy is to lay an odium implicitely and in the dark upon us, I mean not onely all the Orthodox Divines, but alſo all the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that have been, or now are, that they are all guilty of ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſeperation and Apoſtacy, in departing from the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue in the Doctrine of Juſtification; therefore hath he ſpread his nets to catch as many as he can, to carry them back into <hi>Babylon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> have (as he hath) a confident and ſwelling opinion of his owne abilities, but let him not ſo abuſe all others, as if ſtar-like their light muſt be totally dazled at the approach of his ſuppoſed ſun-beams. Wretched <hi>England,</hi> if all her Seers are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blind, and none can diſcern Chriſt from Antichriſt, even in his myſtery. Nay let him know that there are many which ſee and
<pb facs="tcp:167891:13"/> deteſt what he hath written, no leſſe then if it had been ſent by the Popes own Legate, to beguile. Ingenuity, truth, and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would have acted another way. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> if he had been ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned therewith, would have plainly acknowledged, that he had examined the Controverſie between us and the Papiſts, about Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; that as far as his comprehenſion can reach, he finds them in the truth, and us erroneous: and then ſhould have alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Scriptures and other Arguments which they produce for the eſtabliſhing of their Tenents, and the Exceptions which in the Reformed Churches have been made againſt ſuch Arguments; and ſhewed the invalidity of thoſe Exceptions, in no wiſe anſwering or weakning the Popiſh Reaſons, by means whereof his judgement and conſcience force him to ſide with them, and not with us. Thus candour and conſcience would have wrought upon him; for he cannot deny, but that both he cloſeth with them in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and that all the Scriptures, Arguments and diſtinctions (ſcarce any excepted) which he brings for the promoting of ſuch Concluſions, are taken from the Papiſts, and have been anſwered over and over a hundred times, by our Divines. Therefore to ſet forth his Aſſertions as new, and to annex his Reaſons for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, as now firſt heard of, argues intolerable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in his daubing and diſſembling. To have dealt thus candidly and conſcientiouſly, would have excited many learned and holy men to a lovely conference with him, which now contemn him as a ſeducer, and ſeduced; but if this had been done, where ſhould the crooked <hi>Serpent, and working of Satan, and Deceivablenaſſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> which ſtill accompany that <hi>Man of ſin, and thoſe that beare his marke,</hi> have appeared? 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>4 And his doubleneſſe and liegerdemain is no leſſe exerciſed, in that thorow-out his Treatiſe, he is ever and anon ſparkling his fire-brands againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> thereby ſecretly inſtilling into his unwary Readers, that it is againſt them this his work mainly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velleth; when contrariwiſe under this name and mask, his War is againſt all the Orthodox Churches and Divines that are or have been ſince the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe all with him are <hi>Antinomians,</hi> as himſelfe ſometimes when they ſtand in his way and ſtirr his paſſion, doth ſomewhat incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately ſpeak out, telling us that he meanes that <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> whereof Dr. <hi>Twiſſ</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> bear up the pillars, <hi>pag.</hi> 73. and conſequently whereof <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the reſt Divines and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
<pb facs="tcp:167891:14"/> employ'd in the Reformation have re-edified the walls, yea <hi>Paul</hi> and Chriſt himſelf have laid the foundation. But this craft he learn'd (as the reſt) from his Maſters the Monks and Jeſuits, who when they ſet themſelves to batter the truth of Chriſt, cry out in their Pulpits and Writings againſt the <hi>Huguenots, Lutherans, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> laying ſuch ſlanders on the truth and them which teach or hold it, that they may ſtirr an Odium in the people, among whom there are ſome ſo ignorant, that dwelling at a diſtance from the Proteſtants, and having never ſeen any of them, they think them not to be men (having heard ſo much evill of them) but ſome Monſters and Devils flown lately out of the bottomles pit, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deceive the world. Therefore are filled with ſuch preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt their Doctrine, that if they were told theſe Hereticks ſay Chriſt is the Son of God and Saviour of the world, they would (in hatred of the ſuppoſed Hereticks) be ready to reject both Chriſt and ſalvation, leſt they ſhould ſeem to hold with them. Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> needs not the incitation of any ſpurr to follow, having ſuch Leaders, and the opportunity alſo ſerved to his ends. He hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken full notice, that in theſe laſt yeares among the greateſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the vulgar part of our Miniſters, the name of <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> hath been the worſt abhomination, and that they have ſo inveigled their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous congregations with the feare and hatred of it, that any Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall, Monkiſh, or Jeſuiticall ſpirits, that would but cry aloud and lift up their voyce againſt <hi>Antinomians,</hi> found welcome not only to their perſons, but to the whole galley-maufry of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, moralities, wood, hay, and ſtubble that they ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. When contrariwiſe, if any ſhould but often name Chriſt and Grace in his Sermon, all were ſhie of him, turned their heels in ſtead of their faces towards him and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though never ſo pretious and wholſome, fearing ſome tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture therein of <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi> This advantage therefore hath hee taken to batter the Doctrine of the Goſpel, under the name of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomiſm,</hi> knowing that if Chriſt himſelf ſhould again deſcend from heaven to preach it in his own perſon, he ſhould under this vizard, finde contempt of himſelf and his Doctrine among the vulgar. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg every divine truth to be ſo ſacred and pretious, that we ought to defend and redeem it from oppreſſion with our very blood. Whatſoever therefore of errours againſt the truth the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> (truly ſo called) have broached, wee ought with all our ſtrength to reſiſt and reject. And hereof I ſhall have occaſion to
<pb facs="tcp:167891:14"/> ſpeak more fully afterward. In the interim I may lay down ſafely and truly theſe two aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> principall aime is by this odious term to fright weak and inconſiderate perſons from the truth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all that catalogue of errors which <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries aſcribeth to the <hi>Antinomians</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> about 100. years ſithence; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A ſecond thing which miniſters occaſion to us to doubt of this mans ſpirituall conſcientiouſneſſe, is his prophaning and vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holy things. We find him oft in this proſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ating religion, conſcience, and the word of God it ſelfe, to the cenſure and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reaſon, yea of naturall and carnall reaſon: and that, thoſe very things which reaſon cannot comprehend, even <hi>things which eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither hath it entred into the heart, but are revealed onely by the word and ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the myſteries of the Goſpel, Juſtification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at ſome times cannot poſſibly evade ſuch Scriptures as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his errours, with what vehemency doth he forth-with lay hold on them to ſacrifice them to ſenſe and reaſon, yea to that which is worſe then ſenſe and reaſon? <hi>Flectere ſi nequeat ſuperos, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheronta movebit,</hi> when heaven is againſt him, he appeals to hell to ſpeak for him, ſummoning together not only the Jeſuites, but the very Ghoſts of the moſt curſed Hereticks by their authority to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his conſcience, and ſubject the word to it. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not here want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that trembling at Gods word,</hi> which is required and found in the Saints? He doth rarely indeed mention the Authors whom he followeth as his Maſters, but that is of craft, that he might not caſt an Odium upon his Doctrine, he thinks it more fit to offer it as ſome ſacred thing ſpun out of his own brain, that there might be the leſſe ſuſpicion of it. But that it is drawn out of thoſe channels which I have mentioned, I ſhall be ready to ſhew in particulars, if any doubting ſhall demand it of me. Neither let it offend, that in groſs and courſe terms I ſpeak the truth of the Author. It is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the bent of my diſpoſition ſo to do, were it not that it is the very foundation of all our hopes that is by him battered, and that the profuſe commendation which ſome have given of the man,
<pb facs="tcp:167891:15"/> to draw Diſciples to him, did not force me to ſpeak unſparingly (while truly) to undeceive ſome of my friends, that through cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity either are or might be ſeduced.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the man as he hath been repreſented by others, I ſhal ſay ſomething of him alſo as he renders himſelf to us by this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. I cannot, I will not think him one that is wilfully apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd. But finding him a man of excellent both naturall and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red parts, of a very rationall brain, delighted more in depths than in ſhallows, in the logicall deep and ſerious, than in the lighter, and ſuperficiary parts of learning. I conceive him to have been carryed out by his own Genius to the reading of the deepeſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick writers, with the purpoſe that <hi>Virgil</hi> once applyed himſelf to the reading of <hi>Ennius,</hi> though not with the ſame ſucceſſe. The purpoſe of both probably was to fetch out <hi>ê ſtercore gemmam,</hi> a jewel out of the dunghill. But this man meeting with learning perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeing with his naturall Genius, became impotent to obtaine his purpoſe; for being delighted with the dunghil, he hath made it his ſphere and element; the depth of rationality which he found in his Authors, hath drawn and captivated him to their moſt curſed opinions: ſo that we find him in ſtead of a Gemm, bringing forth a Cockatrice-egg, which if it be not deſtroyed in the ſhell, will ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine himſelf and many others. It is an infirmity that hath made impreſſion in points leſſe momentous, upon ſome perſons of great note in the Church. I ſhall mention one <hi>Hierom</hi> in ſtead of the reſt. In his works as they are ſet forth by <hi>Eraſmus, Tom.</hi> 1. there is a Book intituled, <hi>Catalogos Scriptorum Eccleſiaſticorum;</hi> in which <hi>Hierom</hi> mentioning <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and not being able to deny his falling into <hi>Montaniſm,</hi> he thus at leaſt minceth his fault. <hi>Invidia &amp; contumeliis Clericorum Romanae Eccleſiae ad Montani dogma delapſus eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>i e.</hi> through the envy and reproaches which he ſuffered from the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Rome,</hi> he declined to the opinion of <hi>Montanus. Eraſmus</hi> in his Scholia upon theſe words thus writeth, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t favit Hieronimus ingenio Tertulliani,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> See how <hi>Hierom</hi> favoured <hi>Tertullians</hi> wit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt excuſing him for falling into the faction of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault upon the envy and reproaches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts. So farr <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> He might have further added [ſo farr he delighted in <hi>Tertullians</hi> wit, that he did not only excuſe him, but alſo] was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the pleaſing ſtream of his wit and learning, into the very dregs of <hi>Montaniſm</hi> as deep as <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf. So ſhall wee finde him diſcovering himſelf at the full, in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:167891:15"/> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> himſelf in his Antidote prefixed thereunto doth hint, but the work it ſelf makes it notoriouſly plain. It contents not that good Monk Father, there to produce as his own, all <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> arguments, except he alſo delivers them for the moſt part in <hi>Tertullians</hi> very words, ſo that there were not wanting ſuch as excepted againſt him as a very <hi>Montaniſt.</hi> I ſpeak not to leſſen the worth of thoſe two ancient Writers, but to manifeſt in theſe two great and ſublimated <hi>Wits,</hi> when the Genius of one man ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth with anothers, as to delight abundantly, it is as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and iron to draw &amp; to follow into falſhood as well as truth, except there be interpoſed much of the ſpirit of grace and meeknes, and ſo high an eſteem of the Word, that the mind explodes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning as baſe in compariſon of it. No marvail then if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having immixt himſelf into whole troops of Schoolmen, Jeſuits, and others of the ſame Scholaſtick train with himſelf, hath been carried away in the crowd captive to their baſeſt errors. Some would marvail rather how there ſhould be found in <hi>England</hi> any Divines profeſſing antipathy to <hi>Rome,</hi> applauding the very worſt piece of <hi>Romes</hi> Heriſies, as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath breathed upon and bleſſed it. But the caſe is the ſame. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> well knew in what water to angle that he might catch, he perceived that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification for theſe fifty years hath been too little prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in <hi>England.</hi> That ſince the heat of controverſie betwixt us and the Papiſts about it abated, this Doctrine ſounded in few Pulpits, which before ſounded in all, that the <hi>Pia fraus</hi> (as they termed it) prevailed every where, a godly deceit to with-hold from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the knowledg of the libertie which they have by Chriſt, leſt they ſhould turn it into licentiouſneſſe. That as this pions fraud paſſed from hand to hand among the Miniſters, many of them while they were deceiving, were themſelves deceived, and verily thought it the right art of profitable preaching to hold out the Law, and keep in the Goſpel, to <hi>waſh the utter part of the cup and platter, leaving that which is within full of guilt and corruption.</hi> Hence it came to paſs that the Law by many was turned to a two-fold uſe, like the ſword of <hi>Achilles</hi> to <hi>Tilephus,</hi> to wound firſt, and then to heale, to caſt down and to erect again, to kill and make alive, to damn and then to ſave alſo. Firſt, it was ſo brandiſhed for conviction, that all men by the light and curſe thereof might be compelled to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſin and condemnation, and then held forth as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign remedy againſt damnation, and means of ſalvation; ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances
<pb facs="tcp:167891:16"/> for ſin, ſuch degrees of contrition and reformation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed out of the Law, which being practiced, pardon of ſin and eternall life muſt needs follow. Thus man was made not only his own condemner, but his own Saviour alſo; his evill works in tranſgreſſing the Law purſuing him with vengeance, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning by repentance to good works in ſtrict obedience to the law, reſtoring him to life &amp; ſalvation. In mean while Chriſt was left in a corner to look upon all, but without interpoſition of his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Paſſion. Sometimes indeed much might be heard of the riches of Gods Grace, of the efficacy of Chriſts merits to ſave the chief of ſinners, ſo that the people might even ſee the door of heaven open to them; but in concluſion, the Preacher as if he had been deputed to the office of the Cherubims, <hi>Gen. 2. ult.</hi> to keep the way of the tree of life, with his flaming ſword turning every way, affrighted the poor ſoules from all hope of entring, crying <hi>procul hinc, procul ite prophani,</hi> no prophane or unclean perſon hath right to meddle with this Grace. No, firſt they muſt have ſuch heart-preparations, purifications, and prejacent qualifications, before they draw neer to partake of mercy; muſt firſt cleanſe and cure themſelves, and then come to Chriſt afterwards; muſt be cloathed with an inherent Righteouſneſſe firſt, and then expect to be cloathed upon with a Righteouſneſſe imputed. Such hath been and ſtill is the Doctrine delivered in many Congregations within this Nation. I neither fain nor aggravate. It is that whereof my ſelf not without griefe have been oft an ear-witneſſe, and that from the mouths of very zealous Miniſters. And I fear the Lord hath a controverſie againſt the Miniſtry, and will more yet obſcure and vilifie many of them for their obſcuring of his grace and his Chriſt. Now when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were by the tide of their own judgments moving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not a little in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> way, no marvail if they have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him among themſelves to hoyſe the ſailes and carry them haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and further than they before had purpoſed; ſpecially when all the way along and thorowout his whole Treatiſe he deals with them as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did with the <hi>Syrians,</hi> telling them that he is leading them to <hi>Dothan,</hi> to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> holding their eyes and wits ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded until he hath brought them into the ſtreets of <hi>Samaria,</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 8, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This I thought fit to premiſe of the Author, the next thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed was touching the work it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Whether we conſider the matter or the artifice of it, I cannot in
<pb facs="tcp:167891:16"/> generall otherwiſe give a livelier character or deſcription thereof, than in the words of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> in his Tractate <hi>De Gratiâ gratis Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficante,</hi> againſt <hi>Oſorius</hi> and others, where he gives his cenſure upon a book of the ſame argument with Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Oſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> not as this man under the name of a Proteſtant, but ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profeſſing himſelf a Papiſt.

                  <p>Here I ſhall ſpeak only of the form and artifice of the work, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what foundation he hath laid, by what pillars he ſupports his own aſſertions, and with what Engins and Machinations hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth the ſacred truth, and judgment of all Orthodox Divines, whom he makes his adverſaries. In all this he followeth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Schoolmen and Jeſuites, baulking the Scriptures, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maximes of Philoſophy and carnall, or at leaſt humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the foundation of his whole building, &amp; walls and pillars it up with ſophiſticall Arguments, Diſtinctions, &amp; quodlib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Indeed ſometimes he quotes Scriptures in heaps, (as they were prepar'd to his hands by Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Jeſuits) and lets them out without meaſure or tale, telling us that he will ſtand to and be tryed by the Scriptures: but ſcarce at any time vouchſafing to make known what hee would diduce thence, and how; and many times not affording the labour to name the words, and then hyeth back to his Sanctuary St. <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> again: declaring both at how cheap a rate he valueth the ſacred word, not deigning either to cite the words, or at beſt to tell us what he thinks he hath found in them (when contrariwiſe if he cite any thing out of the heathen Philoſophers, or their followers, the Popiſh Doctors unnamed, he is very buſie to preſſe and improve it to his advantage) and withall, that his meaning is to be tryed by the boon ſonns of the unholy Catholick Church: therefore turns us over to them for our in formation what may be gathered from the Scriptures produced, himſelfe paſſing by it as a thing already done to his hands by them.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the main ſtrength of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> and his leaders in fighting againſt the verity of the Goſpel, conſiſteth in this ſubtle and unſcripturall way of diſputation, it ſhall not be impertinent
<pb facs="tcp:167891:17"/> to digreſſe a while in diſcuſſing what force there is in ſophiſticall, (or to uſe milder words) Logicall, Philoſophicall, and Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall argumentations, to confirm or infirm Evangelical Doctrines. In Natural, Moral, Civil, and Oeconomical queſtions they may be (I acknowledg) very uſefull. Yea Logick in its ſober and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe, applyed as an inſtrument to aſſiſt in the contexture and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Scriptures to finde out the ſenſe and meaning thereof; and further, as by diſcreet joyning of Goſpel poſitions together, it helpeth to elicite ſure and ſound concluſions, (not at all drawing the queſtion out of its own ſphere the Scriptures, to be judged and concluded by the nicities and quiddities of other beſides Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learning) may be profitably uſed in Evangelicall queſtions.

                  <p>I know what to expect for ſuch a diſcourſe upon this ſubject.

                  </p>
                  <p>Be it ſo, I neither arrogate nor uſurp to my ſelf the praiſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning. In reference to ſalvation and juſtification, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould glory in any thing but in the Croſſe of Chriſt, or ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to know any thing ſave Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> To plead my righteouſneſs; before God, and againſt Satan, the ſimplicity of the Goſpel plenarily furniſheth and contenteth me; leaving it to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (if he think it ſafe) with ſophiſticall ſubtleties to diſpute himſelf into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe the poſition ſtands firm even in the fall of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the aſſertor, That ſuch humane learning is of no force to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, judg, and conclude any thing in queſtions meerly Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, ſuch as is Juſtification, and all other Goſpel-graces and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. This may be with much facility evidenced to as many as have not their eyes blinded by the God of this world as yet, and that by theſe following reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the Doctrines of the Goſpel are tranſcendent, high, and above the reach of the moſt ſublimated reaſon. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor
<pb facs="tcp:167891:18"/> eare heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to know them,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9. The natural man receiveth not, cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. ibid. <hi>Verſ. 14. They are myſteries hid in God from the</hi> beginning of the world, <hi>from ages and generations, but at laſt made known by the Spirit in the preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> not only to the Saints [on earth] but alſo to <hi>the Principalities and powers in heavenly places, i. e.</hi> to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Angels and Spirits before God in heaven, <hi>Epheſ. 13. 9, 10. Col.</hi> 3. 26, 27. So that at the revelation thereof by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>the very Angels deſired to looke into them,</hi> as learners of that ſacred Doctrine which before they had not attained, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. But all this humane learning whereof we ſpeak, is naturall, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing originally from naturall and heathen men, who in their either moſt profound or moſt ſublime ſpeculations, could not ſee a ſpan above Nature, no nor to the top of Nature by many fathoms. Therefore is there a totall invalidity in it to diſcern one ray of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical and ſpiritual things. To produce any thing therefore out of this humane literature to diſcern and judg of Goſpel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; is no leſſe folly than to make a blind man judg of colours, or a deaf man of ſounds, or to ſet a dead man to running of a race. Yea to hold forth any thing hence, to cleer up and evidence ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, is but to hold a candle, nay a dark Lanthorn to the Sun, for the cleering of its beams that we may ſee it.</p>
                  <p>If any object, that Spiritual and Evangelical Doctrines are by none brought (as Spiritual and Evangelical) under the Tryall of this humane learning, but as they fall under ſome Topicks of this or that Art or Science, as <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, Subſtantia, Accidens, Actio, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo farr only they are diſputed of by and according to the Maximes and Canons of thoſe places.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that even this is to ſubject ſupernatural Doctrines to the judgment and cenſure of Natural Reaſon. It will not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the firſt Founders of theſe Arts and the precepts thereof were meerely Naturall and Morall men, and neither did nor could accommodate their precepts and rules to any other but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Moral things; were ſo farr unable to reach them to things ſupenatural, that they left them in many things unperfect as to things natural: ſo that after all the amendments of all their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, not a few of their Canons remain diſputable and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted (as to Natural and Moral things) ſtill. Therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſpiritual things to the judgment of this Natural learning, is
<pb facs="tcp:167891:18"/> to ſubject the Authority of Chriſt to the Authority of men, the wiſdome of the Spirit to the wiſdome of the Fleſh, and that which is infallible to that which is both fallible and fallacious. Nay all the doctrines and precepts of Philoſophers are to be tryed by the word; but in no wiſe are the dictates of the Spirit, and doctrines of the word of grace to be tryed by the precepts of Men. I forbeare to ſpeak here, that otherwiſe not Chriſt but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> muſt in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation be made our <hi>Ipſe Dixit:</hi> or that none but Schollars can have any ſtable ſetledneſſe of faith, the unlearned in humane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature remaining uncapable thereof, becauſe they cannot prove the truth of what they believe as well by the rules of Art, as by the Teſtimony of the word of Chriſt. I only ſay, when Chriſt by his word hath ſaid and determined, here not to ſubject and reſt ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to conſult with fleſh and blood, with the rules of humane Art for my fuller reſolution, is no leſſe indignity to Chriſt, than to ſet mans wiſedom in the Chair, and to proſtrate Chriſt to be his Footſtool.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it have any power and efficacy to this end, it muſt be either from ſome naturall and intrinſicall vertue of its own, or elſe by Gods ordination and infuſion. Not by any naturall vertue of its own, as appeareth by what was laſt ſaid, and by this that none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by ſuch ſecular learning attained one leaſt ſpark of Goſpel-knowledg, nor yet by Gods ordination, and inſpiring ſtrength into it to operate for ſuch an end. For let it be declared in what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God inſtituted or owned it as an in-ſtrument uſefull and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualized for ſuch a work. And if neither of theſe ways it be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, or in a capacity either to declare or confirm Goſpel-matters, then hath it no power at all to ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>If any thing be excepted againſt in this Argument, it muſt be the latter disjunctive particle thereof in the Aſſumption which denieth the humane learning before mentioned to be ordained of God, or qualified by him as inſtrumental and effectual to determine any thing in Evangelical and Spiritual Doctrines. But this may be cleered and confirmed by the Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe neither the Lord Chriſt nor any of his Apoſtles or Prophets have made uſe of it to this end. Not his Prophets under the Old Teſtament: For when they ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke any thing of the Myſtery of Chriſt and his Goſpel that were afterward more fully to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, they did it <hi>by inſpiration from God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſpirit of Chriſt which was in them,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11. not as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:167891:19"/> dipped the ſame, from the broken Ciſterns of humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and learning. And when they will add a confirmation to ſuch Doctrines, the only authority which they produce is divine. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, The Lord of Hoſts hath ſaid it, the holy, the lofty, the mighty one of Iſroel hath ſpoken it,</hi> without any Philoſophical or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical Arguments to prove it. No leſſe is to be ſaid of Chriſt himſelf our own and only Mr. when he deſcended from Heaven to reveal his Goſpel in its fulneſs and glory, affirming his <hi>doctrine to be</hi> onely and wholly <hi>that which his Father taught him,</hi> Joh. 8. 28. <hi>which he had ſeene with his father,</hi> Joh. 8. 38. <hi>as he had commandement from his father,</hi> Joh. 10. 18. <hi>even as the father ſaid unto him,</hi> Joh. 12. 50. <hi>as he heard from his father,</hi> Joh. 15. 15. Lo all from heaven, from the Father; nothing from earth from men, in revealing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. No nor to the confirmation of it being revealed, ſave his own and his Fathers teſtimonie, <hi>Joh. 8. 18. Joh.</hi> 5. 31,—37. Let there be but an <hi>iota</hi> produced of this kind of literature whereof I treat, that our Saviour any where uſed for the confirmation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-doctrines which hee delivered. Nay, hee denies all ability and poſſibility, that any man by naturall or acquired parts ſhould ſee or ſhew forth (untill he hath received divine revelation) one ray of Goſpel-light; Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> had made but a courſe and confuſed or obſcure confeſſion of Chriſt, he anſwers, <hi>Bleſſed be thou Simon Barjonah, for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. 16, 17. Inſinuating that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry threſhold of Goſpel-knowledg is tranſcendent and above all the reach of humane Arts, and fleſhly or naturall wiſdome, to find it out for themſelves, or make it out to others. Hence are the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concluſions and aſſertions which hee layeth down to this purpoſe. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they ſhall be all taught of God: Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh to me,</hi> Joh. 6. 44, 45. <hi>No one knoweth the Sonn but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father but the Sonn, and he to whom the ſonn will reveal him.</hi> What he ſpeaketh of knowing the Son and the Father, he meaneth of knowing the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God touching the Goſpel-way in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he hath purpoſed to bring ſinners to ſalvation. This is a wiſdome not borrowed of, but <hi>hidden</hi> from [moſt of] <hi>the wiſe and prudent</hi> [in ſecular learning] <hi>and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to babes,</hi> Mat. 11. 25-27. And the Scripture giveth reaſons why there is no power in the wiſdome and learning of men to dive into the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and Evangelical knowledg of God.

                     <hi>the boſome of the Father hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1. 18. <hi>No man hath aſcended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the ſonne of man which is in heaven,</hi> Joh. 3. 13. <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him. Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. What is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the knowledg of God, is to be underſtood as in the former Texts, the knowing of Gods will and myſterious way of bringing many ſons (ere while enemies) to glory. The ſcope of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in theſe Scriptures runs thus. None but ſuch as have ſeen God, ſeen into him, have been in heaven with him, nay have been in his very heart and boſom, can poſſibly know the mind and purpoſe of God hidden in himſelf touching the juſtification and ſalvation of men. But Chriſt only &amp; the Spirit of Chriſt have been, and are ſtill in heaven, have ſeen God, and are in the boſom of God reading and knowing all the purpoſes of his mind. Therefore none but Chriſt and his Spirit alone know and can reveale this mind of God to us. The Scripture here ſpeaketh of Teachers, none hath been in heaven to come thence as a Teacher into the world of what he hath ſeen in the boſom of God, but the Son and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And the teaching or revealing of which it ſpeaketh, is meant original teaching and revealing. None can reveal the mind of God but the Son and the Spirit, or they to whom the Son hy his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Spirit hath firſt revealed it. What weight then can there be in the Teſtimony or learning of the Heathen Philoſophers, or of the Angelical and Seraphical Doctors of the Romiſh Church, who never aſcended the Heavens to look into Gods boſom, and are as void of Chriſt and his Spirit as thoſe Heathens themſelves; that any thing of Goſpel-wiſdome ſhould be grounded upon their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
                  <p>From Chriſt diſcend we to the Apoſtles, and firſt he that <hi>choſe them to goe forth into the world to bring forth fruit,</hi> Joh. 15. 16. (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel to bring home many ſouls to God) to furniſh them with abilities for ſo great end noble a work, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>to ſend unto them the Spirit,</hi> and to what end but <hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16. 13. into the cleer and full knowledg of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious truths of the Goſpel, bidding them not to go to <hi>Athens</hi> to learn from the Philoſophers in their Schools any thing that might further their illumination herein, but <hi>to tarry at Hieruſalem untill they were endued with this power from on high,</hi> Luk. 24. 49. And if we
<pb facs="tcp:167891:20"/> look to the accompliſhment of the promiſe, <hi>Acts 2. 1, &amp;c.</hi> we ſhall finde that the Holy Ghoſt diſcending in a glorious manner upon them, wrought on them, if not only, yet principally theſe three ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as abundantly ſufficient to enable them for the <hi>Apoſtleſhip and Miniſtry of the New Teſtament,</hi> as the Apoſtle terms his Office, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ſudden and wonderfull irradiation of them with all the depths of Goſpel-knowledg, that <hi>without communion with fleſh and blood,</hi> they had the ſacred ſecrets of the Goſpel made out in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to them by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as afterwards <hi>Paul</hi> manifeſteth the Lord Jeſus to have dealt with him in like manner, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. 16. And thus they that were but mechanick and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, were filled ſuddenly with light and knowledg enough to enlighten the whole world then in darkneſſe.</p>

                  <p>And 2ly. with that learning and power ſo received, they went on in the execution of their Miniſtry, ſo far from uſing, as that they purpoſely rejected the uſe of humane reaſon and wiſdome, holding faſt to the word alone as the mind of God therein was revealed to them by the Spirit, for their rule in preaching, and authority in confirming the truth of the Goſpel which they taught.

                  <p>Now if neither Chriſt nor his truly inſpired Miniſters ever uſed, or would uſe this kind of learning in Goſpel-matters, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will neceſſarily follow that it was never of Gods ordination.

                  <p>Unto this I ſhal add but two Teſtimonies more; the one, when the Apoſtle hath to do with a company of Chriſtians dwelling among the Philoſophers, in great jealouſie &amp; fear of them, he cryes out, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware ye be not ſpoiled with Philoſophy, Col</hi> 2. 7. &amp; vain decit. He ſpeaks of no poſſibility of any good that there ſhould accrew unto them by the help of Philoſophy, but of great danger to be ſpoyled and corrupted by it; and when is there ſuch hazard of being corrupted by it? he anſwers, when men intermingle this learning, which is but of humane invention and <hi>tradition, after the Rudiments of the world,</hi> after and not above carnall and worldly <hi>Reaſon,</hi> with the Scripture, in meaſuring out to themſelves the ſaving Goſpel, and take not it up <hi>after Chriſt</hi> ſimply and unmixedly as Chriſt hath taught it, and put the impreſſe of his authority upon it, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 8. The other that for prevention of corruption by this ſecular learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Converts of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> while the Apoſtle was yet reſident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and conſequently conſenting with them, <hi>burnt their bookes of curious Arts,</hi> which though ſome will have to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of conjuring books, yet I cannot aſſent to them, becauſe this curſed rather then curious Art, was proper and almoſt peculiar to the more Eaſtern people, <hi>Jewes, Samaritans, Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> very little or not at all ſtudying it, but placing all their wiſdom in the Arts whereof I have been hitherto diſcourſing, and theſe were <hi>Greeks</hi> that burnt the bookes of thoſe curious Arts which they ſtudied, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 19. If then any conclude that the H: Ghoſt at any time doth ſo much abaſe and deface an Ordinance of God; Let him alſo conclude this kind of learning and diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ordained of God for the confirming and promoting of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:167891:22"/>
                  <p>A third Reaſon to prove that God hath not ordained this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall or Philoſophicall learning to be inſtrumentall for the promoting of the Goſpel, may be drawn from experience it ſelf. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we never find to be bleſſed, but ſtill blaſted of God to the hurt both of the Churches that have been admirers and followers of Sophiſticall teachers of the Goſpel, and of ſuch teachers alſo, cannot be the Ordinance of God; for he alway accompanieth and breaths his bleſſing in greater or leſſer degrees upon the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Ordinances. But God hath never bleſſed, but ſtill ſo blaſted and brought to nought &amp; naught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the uſe of this philoſophicall and philoſophaſtrous learning. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not of Gods ordination, I mean to be intermingled with ſpirituall, and Evangelicall Doctrines. For hence alone we baniſh it, not denying it to be uſefull in naturall and morall things, as I have before granted.</p>
                  <p>That it hath been ſo blaſted as intermingled with Goſpel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, experience it ſelf evidenceth.

                     </gap>e went forth acting only by the authority of Chriſts miſſion, and according to the rule of his Commiſſion, the very <hi>Devills became ſubject to them, and Satan fell as lightning before them,</hi> at the ſound of the Goſpel which they had charge to preach alone, and ground upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture alone, while this charge was faithfully put in execution, whole Nations either after the other, yea the whole world [almoſt] came to be diſcipled to Chriſt. <hi>God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mightily with them by many ſignes and wonders to make their Miniſtry ſuccesfull.</hi> But when anon there entred into the Churches rightly grounded and ſtabliſhed, falſe Apoſtles of the <hi>Jewes</hi> that preached a legall and naturall righteouſneſſe that reaſon and naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcience could ſuggeſt (if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had been ſilent) as neceſſary to be joyned with the Goſpel-righteouſneſſe of Faith to Juſtification: And on the other ſide there aroſe out of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Gentiles ſome of themſelves <hi>that ſpake perverſe things ſeeking to introduce the like</hi> naturall righteouſneſſe out of the Ethicks of the Philoſophers, and to maintain their Doctrines, mainly if not wholly by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> dialectick ſubtleties: And both theſe began to
<pb facs="tcp:167891:22"/> be favoured by wanton wits within the Churches: Now the Lord turned his hinder parts to them on whom erewhile the light of his countenance ſhined, the glory of the Goſpel became more and more clouded, the Churches rended and torn in pieces, abounding more with Apoſtates than with Chriſtians indeed, as may be large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted from the New Teſtament if there were need.</p>
                  <p>From the Apoſtles time diſcend we to the next ages or age after the Apoſtles, and I find not among the Writers of note any one much ſtudious of Philoſophy (much leſſe ſpoyled with it) <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> only excepted, and he enough moderate in the uſe of it. But ſhortly after him ſprung up <hi>Origen,</hi> a great and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Writer: in his youth beyond his age hopefull, but in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity carryed with full ſails to the ſtudy of ſecular Arts, and with ſuch ſucceſſe, that <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Catalogue of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Writers</hi> renders him in ſuch learning unmatchable by any going before, or following him; as one thorowly ſeen in all the differing opinions of all the ſeverall ſects of Philoſophers, a notable Logician and Diſputer, and fully read in all the Liberall Arts, and as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the practical part as the Theory of all.</p>
                  <p>Now from a man ſo accompliſht in ſo many perfections (as ſome term them) would poſſibly be expected a greater ſucceſſe of his preaching and writing than ever <hi>Paul</hi> attained, becauſe ſo much more learned then <hi>Paul:</hi> But the caſe proved contrary. Out of his brain thus filled, iſſued errors and hereſies as thick as hail-ſtones from the Clouds. Nothing of Scripture, Law or Goſpel could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape his depravation, and a Religion he ſet forth, like <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcaron, a meer galleymaufry of Heterogeneous fancies, ſome <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> and ſome in ſhew at leaſt <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> compounded and confounded one with the other, ſo that there could not be a fouler abhomination then ſuch a Religion. Why? becauſe he had attained ſo much ſecular learning? not ſo, but becauſe he wrought with untempered morter, mixing Philoſophy and Chriſtianity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which cloſe as ſweetly as light and darkneſſe. Hence was it that all the Churches at length exploded him for an Heretick, and his writings as Pſeudo-Chriſtian; and <hi>Hierom</hi> ſo wounded his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among the learned and godly, for writing ſomewhat in the praiſe of him, that with all his palliating and recanting, hee could not fully repayr it to his dying day. Yea the ſtinch of him hath offended all the godly Divines of our Reformed Churches, notwithſtanding his antiquity, that they reject him. From the
<pb facs="tcp:167891:23"/> pen of one <hi>Beza,</hi> we may know the mind of the reſt, who calls him <hi>hominem impuram</hi> ſometimes, and ſometimes <hi>hominum impuriſſimum,</hi> an impure or a prophane man, yea the prophaneſt of men, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning Scriptures, Goſpel, Religion, and all other ſacred things that he medled with.</p>
                  <p>At no long diſtance after <hi>Origen</hi> lived <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who finding the Church by the evill Artifice of <hi>Origen,</hi> and other Philoſophicall Chriſtians like him, over ſpread with hereſies, applies himſelfe to ſeek the cure thereof. And a principall means he preſcribeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is a faſt adhering to the doctrine of Chriſt, all other authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in divine things being rejected. <hi>It is not lawfull for us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to bring in any thing [of faith or worſhip] out of our own will or judgment, nor to admit any thing what another hath introduced of his will and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>Now when at length by the valour of <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> they were diſcomfited, and wholly driven out of theſe chriſtian Lands, after their ſubverſion, there ſprung out of the Barbariſm which they left behind them, a <hi>Barabarian</hi> ſect of Divines, more pernicious to Religion then the <hi>Goths</hi> &amp; <hi>Vandals</hi> had been. In a general term they are uſually called Schoolmen or School-Doctors. Theſe like the <hi>Babel</hi>-builders erected upon other foundations, and of other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials a <hi>Babel</hi>-Church, with ſuch barbarous ſlime in ſtead of cement and morter, as was never before uſed ſince the firſt building of the old <hi>Babel;</hi> who exauctorating Chriſt and his Goſpel from having any ſoveraignty in matters of Religion, and permitting them but now and then to peep for their advantage, canoniz'd <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the moſt ſubtle, but untill then the leaſt regarded of all the ſects of Heathen Philoſophers, to be their <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> choſe <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to be their Text, themſelves to be the Commentators.

The God whom they ſerve and ſacrifice unto in all is not Chriſt but Antichriſt, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and decrees aſſoon as they have received, they muſt and will with all their Hyperborean conjurations of ghaſtly words, defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,

Nimble work-men, leaving a glory upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes when they meet with ſublunary matter, with a ſubject not above the comprehenſion of natural reaſon, but ſuch whereof all men have an idea or image within their Synteriſis, or natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but when they meet with Goſpel-doctrine, that makes men wiſe to ſalvation, blinder than <hi>Balaam,</hi> that ſaw leſs than his Aſſe which hee rode upon. Theſe have erected and held up many hundred years a religion which can ſave none, but damneth all that cleave ſtrictly to it, and they have this peculiar vertue that they have ſtill waxed worſ and worſ, the ſecond generation more impure than the firſt, and the third than the ſecond, and ſo line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally every generation almoſt until now: ſave that in theſe laſt times they have attained ſo much of the ſubtlety, falſhood and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of Satan, that there is ſcarce a poſſibility of receiving a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addition. If then any man will read how far the humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which I am ſpeaking, may be helpful to propagate &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the truth of the Goſpel, let him but look back to the fruit of theſe ſophiſtical Doctors Labours theſe many hundred years laſt paſt, and by that which hee ſeeth he ſhalbe able to anſwer himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that it hath been and is powerful to deface and ſubvert utterly the whole truth and ſalvation of the Goſpel in relation to their Diſciples that reſt upon their Learning and Precepts: for look what of Religion, worſhip and ordinances there is in the Popiſh Church, the praiſe of it redounds to philoſophy and ſophiſtry the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of laying its ground-work, and the ſole inſtruments (unleſs ye will annex to it the fire and fagot, and tyrannical inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) for the maintenance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeen how great a corruption, and how long a deſolation of the truth of Religion there hath been, while Sophiſtry was made its perfidious Advocate. We are now in the next place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the ſame truth of Chriſtian Religion thrived when deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the captivity of, and communion with this ſecular Learning.</p>
                  <p>After the long holding of the purity of the Goſpel in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, by theſe Theologaſters, it pleaſed God to raiſe up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the reformation of his Church, men of his own choiſe, and gifted with a meaſure of the Spirit, anſwering ſo great a work to which they were deputed; as <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and many other
<pb facs="tcp:167891:25"/> learned and godly men, ſome their contemporaries, ſome their followers. Theſe reſtored the Scriptures to light again, which had been many hundred years buried in darknes, and preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the true and clear Goſpel which had been long alſo clouded with mens inventions, traditions and ſuperſtitions. What ſucceſs this their Miniſtry had, cannot be unknown to them that know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the hiſtory of thoſe times. Diſciples came in by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands unto Chriſt, being totally revolted from Antichriſt. Whole Kingdoms, Nations, Dukedoms, that ere while worſhipped the Beaſt, now fell flat at the feet of Chriſt to ſubmit to his Scepter. And this not as conſtrained by the command of their Magiſtrates or Laws, but even while Magiſtrates and Laws ſlept, yea when Magiſtrates and Laws perſecuted with Fire and Sword all that went this way: even then <hi>the Kingdom of heaven ſuffered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent tooke it by force, i. e.</hi> by an unreſiſtible convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word, and wonderful operation of this Spirit upon their ſouls, they were carryed out in contempt of all dangers and perſecutions to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt purely revealed in his righteouſnes, beawty and ſalvation to them. So that in few years, maugre all the malice of the Pope, Emperour, Kings, Princes, World, and Hell, Chriſt might be even ſeen reigning in the midſt of his Enemies, and whole Lands, at leaſt great multitudes of many Lands which were darknes, became light in the Lord, even ſo farr as we ſee the Proteſtant Religion at this day propagated.</p>
                  <p>If it be demanded here, how it came to paſs that the word and truth of Religion in ſo ſhort a time, ſo mightily grew and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo great a part of the world from ſo ſmall and even deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable a beginning, became ſo fully and ſo quickly ſeaſoned with it? It were a full anſwer (I acknowledg) to ſay, <hi>It was the Lords time, and he would ſo have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Lords operations are all done in wiſdom, truth, and righteouſneſs, an inferiour ſubordinate cauſe viſible to our eies may be alſo alledged: when the Lord had purpoſed to do this great work, he ordained and fitted inſtruments for it. The Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which he employed the firſt threeſcore years and upward about the work of Reformation, were ſuch as clave only and wholly to the word, both in preaching and defending the ſacred truth of the Goſpel, minding only Chriſt Jeſus, not ſeeking their own things, their own greatneſs, glory and praiſe, but the things of Chriſt. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed all other authority ſave Chriſts, knew no other, admitted no
<pb facs="tcp:167891:26"/> other Maſter, to define and determine any thing in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but Chriſt alone. Therefore whether they provoked the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, or were provoked by them to diſputation, their chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, or receiving the challenge, was ſtil upon this condition, that the Word alone muſt be umpire in all things. Thus they had Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes before the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the 5. ſo they offered themſelves to be diſputers in the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> But ſtill refuſed the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and his genuine ſons <hi>Thom: Aquinas, John Duns, Scotus,</hi> and the whole rabble of their followers, and all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and learning of ſuch, as incompetent Judges of heavenly things. Thus theſe holy men ploughed the Lords field, with his own Heyfers, and ſowed it with his own ſeed, therefore he gave ſo large an encreaſe. They preached (as they had commandment and commiſſion from him) only his Goſpel, and all and only whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had commanded them, therefore according to his promiſe he was with them giving a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>But if it be further demanded, how it came to paſs at laſt that there was a ſtop to the glorious proceedings of the ſucceſs of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel theſe laſt ſixty years, that we ſee not any further propagation of the truth, but Antichriſt rather regaining ſtrength than loſing, and the kingdom of Chriſt rather declining than increaſing?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that as about that time the new ſect of <hi>Loyalla,</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, came to ſome maturity, who being <hi>ſpes ultima Romae ruentis,</hi> the laſt ſubſidiary help of the Romiſh nodding and falling power, perceived that they might ſeek but not find any fulture from the Scriptures to their fainting cauſe; therefore applied themſelves to the ſtudy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the Pagan, and the Schoolmen the Semi-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, drinking into themſelves their ſophiſtry, and refining it into ſom-what a purer Language, (though moſt of them retain a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical ſtyle ſtill): And being thus furniſhed, they provoke our Divines to a diſpute, objecting againſt them, that through their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and illiterate ſottiſhneſs, they dared not to diſpute ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtically, therefore ſtill cryed <hi>Scripture, Scripture,</hi> to hide their want of Schollarſhip from the eyes of men. As about that time (I ſay) there were in ſuch an operation, a new kind of <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> againſt the power of the Goſpel: So on our part in many Churches, there ſucceeded the former Worthies, about the ſame time, Paſtors in their own eyes poſſibly of a more noble, but in ſpiritual eyes of a baſer mettall: who to evade that ſcandal laid upon us by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb facs="tcp:167891:26"/> that we deſtroyed good works by our Doctrine of free Grace through Chriſt, preached ſome mens inventions, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and traditions; others meer moralities, legalities, or duties after the tenor of the Law, ſcarce touching upon the ſtrings of the Goſpel to tune up the Juſtification, Life, Liberty, Peace, Joy, and other priviledges which are by Chriſt: And to gain to themſelves an applauſe and opinion among men of their univerſal Learning, aſſented to the forenamed Challengers to diſcend to them in their own Field, and to traverſe their Diſputes about heavenly things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rules of worldly wiſedom, thus baſely proſtituting the cauſe and doctrine of the Lord Chriſt, to the cenſure and arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heathen Philoſophers, and of <hi>John Duns,</hi> and other enemies to the purity of the Goſpel. For in trying all by their learning, by the light of Reaſon which they have dazled and ſophiſticated with their rules and precepts, is to make them judges of Chriſt and his Goſpel, how farr they ſhall ſtand or fall. Who can deny, but in ſtead of the former Eagles which the Church had, that ſtil beheld the Sun of righteouſnes, to fetch their light from his beams; we had now Owls that looked downward, and pitched upon the elements and rudiments of the world and worldly learning (as the Apoſtle terms them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8.) to fetch light &amp; authority thence in pretence to maintain the truth, but in deed and ſucceſſe to betray it? No marvell if in this caſe Chriſt hath with-drawn himſelf and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſuch Apologiſts for his Cauſe, which plead for him with ſuch a kind of argumentation as is worſe then totall ſilence. For what of Chriſt is there in ſuch diſputes? when the firſt ſyllogiſm, or its proſſyllogiſm, or a diſtinction, diverts the queſtion from all the liſts of Divinity, into Philoſophy or Metaphyſicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not the leaſt parcell or particle of Scripture is any more heard of through the whole diſputation? It is but as it falls ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I have to anſwer againſt ſuch cenſures, 1. That I have written therein nothing but words of ſoberneſs and truth; and I had rather with tediouſneſs make cleer a truth, than to drop errors with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. That it was not againſt my purpoſe to be ſo large, nor yet beſide the mark aimed at. For ſhould I here put a period, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> falſities are more than half anſwered; becauſe that more than half of his Book conſiſteth of meerly ſophiſtical queſtions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, arguments, evaſions, equivocations, diſtinctions and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies. In all which, if there be no force to prove or refute in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-matters; and that God is ſo farr from commanding or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſlights in handling Goſpel-truths, as that he explodes, hates &amp; curſeth the ſame (as hath been manifeſted) then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his work is hereby manifeſted to be vain. As for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the Book, wherein he ſeems to confine himſelf to plain Scripture, he ſeldom and little meddles this way, but in confidence of his Sophiſtry that he hath at hand in ambuſh, to ſuccenturiate and help him at a dead lift, elſe all the fat will quickly be in the fire, his Scripturall reaſons for the moſt part cutting the throat of his own cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One thing yet remaineth which I promiſed to premiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> what my intention is in excepting againſt Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book. This is not either to oppoſe him in all things which he hath written therein. For ſometimes he looks out thorow truths caſement, that we might take him ſo a ſonn of truth, and the leſs ſuſpect him when he vends his falſe wares. In this caſe I will not jangle with
<pb facs="tcp:167891:28"/> him whether he ſpeaks truth of envy and ſubtlety, or of good will and ſincerity. Or 2. in all that ſhal ſeem to my judgment Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in his Treatiſe, but only or mainly in thoſe things wherein he joyneth with the Romiſh Synagogue to maintain their damning doctrine, againſt the truth w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is and hath been profeſſed in all the Reformed Churches about Faith and Juſtification. Or 3. in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular paſſage wherein he diſcovers himſelf in this point to be for Antichriſt againſt Chriſt; for ſometimes he delivers himſelf with ſuch ambiguities and aequivocations, like <hi>Apollo</hi> of old in his Oracles, that in pretence of another ſenſe of his words than the more Grammaticall and uſuall, he may leave a way of iſſue to himſelf, in caſe he cannot maintain his words in that ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would be underſtood that he may deceive. Let it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought all granted that ſhall not be here excepted againſt, and that I approve all whatſoever I do not oppugn. For method, I deſire no other may be expected from me, than to follow Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> in order as he hath written, and to take up his Paradoxes and moſt profound and learned miſtakes as they fall from him, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them, not by the rules of Sophiſtry, but by the touch-ſtone of the ſacred Word.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, we are now to begin to examine the unſavory particulars occurring in the Book it ſelf.</p>

                           <p>Arg. In which Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Popiſh Doctrine of Implicit Faith is examined; and whether the people may admit Doctrine upon truſt from their Teachers.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt paſſage wherein he ſheweth himſelf to ſmel of Popery in the point of Faith and Juſtification, is (before the work it ſelf) in the farewell of his Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>pag. antepenult.</hi> of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where he doth not obſcurely manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to like well enough the Papiſts doctrine of <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and to wiſh it more favoured, and taken up at home among us. His words are theſe, ſpeaking to his Congregation,</p>
                        <q>
                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:167891:30"/>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> Who I hope do underſtand that to take upon truſt from your teachers, what you cannot yet reach to ſee in its own evidence, is leſs abſurd and more neceſſary than many do imagine.</q>
                        <p>A very proper inſinuation to a people whom he would have to ſwallow ſuch Doctrines as in the following Treatiſe he offers to them to be ſwallowed. As far as he prevails, or prevails not with this inſinuation, ſo far he hath or hath not men his Diſciples. This is the very foundation of Antichriſts kingdom, the authority of men, as the foundation of Chriſts kingdom is the authority of the Scriptures. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can perſwade men to admit and ſuck in this Doctrine, his whole buſineſs is finiſhed, and all his ends attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If they take upon truſt even fundamentall doctrines from their teachers, Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> bring what doctrines he will with him of men and Devils, nothing ſhall be refuſed, all ſhall be taken upon his Credit. By this ſlight he knew the Pope had gathered, and many hundred years held under his vaſſallage in blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many nations of the earth, therefore will not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> baulk it, when hee goes about to propagate the Popes doctrine among us.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſee what the Popiſh implicit faith is, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with the Papiſts, to ſee whether there be not in both one mind and ſpirit. The Papiſts diſtinguiſh betwixt Faith and Faith, telling us there is an Explicit and there is an Implicit Faith. By the <hi>Explicit Faith</hi> they mean a cleer and diſtinct knowledg, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and believeng of all the Articles and Doctrines of faith which the holy Mother Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath preſcribed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ſalvation, and that not in a bunch only, but in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars alſo. This Faith they hold needful and expedient in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy (as they term their Prelats and Prieſts) who are to rule over, more than to teach the people. By the <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> they mean a generall and confuſed apprehenſion and believing of all that the Church hath commanded to be taught and believed; that it is all good and true, though they that ſo believe, know not in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar what the Church hath commanded, otherwiſe than they take it upon truſt of their Prieſts which tell them ſuch and ſuch things are commanded by the Church to be believed. This Faith they hold ſufficient for the Laity to ſalvation, to believe what the Church believeth and enjoyneth to be true, though they neither know what it is, nor are acquainted with one leaſt parcell of the word
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167891:30"/> by which they may know it to be true, which they have ſo taken upon truſt to believe. By the Church they mean the Pope and his Clergy, by the Laity the people: So that by their Doctrine, if the Popes decree things in religion ſucceſſively never ſo contrary, and contradictory either to other, and the titular Clergy follow them, and go to Hell for it; yet the people have this one ſupereminent priviledg that their Implicit and Colliers faith ſaves them (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the ſame and unchanged) that they believe as the Church believeth; though they know not either w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church or what believing is, or what the things are w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Church believeth.</p>
                        <p>Compare we now Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words with this popiſh doctrine, and ſee we if there be any difference. <hi>I hope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith <hi>I hope,</hi> we are not to doubt but a man of ſuch rare parts hath good grounds for his hope. He knew there was means uſed to make them underſtand, elſe would he not ſay, <hi>I hope you underſtand;</hi> and what means but teaching? and who ſhould teach them but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> their Teacher?</p>
                        <p>But what is it he hopes they underſtand? it followeth: <hi>That to take upon the truſt of your Teachers, what you cannot yet ſee in its own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is not,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> not to ground their opinions and belief in matters of ſalvation, upon the known word of God, but upon truſt from the Teachers, to believe becauſe their Teachers ſay they belive it. And what are the Teachers, but what in Popiſh phraſe is termed the Church, the Clergy, which is in their account at leaſt the Church repreſentative. And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to decline envy uſeth the plurall number, <hi>Teachers,</hi> not (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) that the people of <hi>Kederminſter</hi> have more <hi>Teachers</hi> in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary beſides himſelf, for he names himſelf in the Title of the book <hi>their unworthy Teacher,</hi> not one of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> ſo that his purpoſe is to deliver a general rule for all Churches: His congragation to take upon truſt from him and other Congregations from their <hi>Teachers,</hi> what they themſelves cannot reach to ſee in its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch doctrines as they themſelves by their own light and knowledg cannot tell whether they be white or black, true or falſe, from Heaven or from Hell. And to do this, <hi>is leſſe abſurd and more neceſſary then many imagin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſcarce yet beginning to diſcover himſelf, therefore we have yet <hi>Bona Verba</hi> from him, we hear him ſpeaking modeſtly; afterward <hi>vires acquirit eundo,</hi> we ſhall when once he is hot in his diſcourſe hear him ſpeak in the full of the mouth; here only he ſaith <hi>leſs abſurd and more neceſſary than ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167891:31"/> But who knows not his meaning to be, that for the people thus to pin their <hi>Faith</hi> to the ſleeves of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> ſpecially to ſuch profound <hi>Teachers</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is ſo far from being abſurd as that it is neceſſary (I ſuppoſe he meaneth to ſalvation) though ſome imbegin otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>Here I would demand (not of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> for I deſire not fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with him while ſuch an <hi>Aphoriſt</hi>) but of any knowing man indulgent to him, when he ſaith, <hi>leſs abſurd and more neceſſary, than ſome imagine;</hi> whom can he mean by thoſe <hi>ſome,</hi> but the Proteſtant Churches and Divines, who at all times with one conſent have cryed out againſt the abſurdity of this doctrine, in their diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Papiſts? And if ſo, what doth he leſs therein than pronounce the Popiſh Doctrine herein neceſſary, and the doctrine of all the Proteſtants in oppoſition to it, a meer imagination?</p>
                        <p>But it may be objected, that the Papiſts lay down this doctrine of <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> or believing upon the authority of the Church, or their Teachers, for a continual rule to the people. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> propoſeth it but as a temporary rule, uſeful only for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Therefore the difference between him and them is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For ſo much may be gathered from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words, to take upon truſt from your <hi>Teachers,</hi> what you cannot <hi>Yet reach to ſee in its own Evidence.</hi> It is but while they are <hi>yet</hi> weak, while they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>yet</hi> reach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when once they are ſtrengthened, and have attained to ſee truths in their own evidence, thenceforth they are to take up ſuch doctrines upon their own evidence, not upon truſt from their <hi>Teachers</hi> any longer.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, This difference is but ſuppoſed, not reall. For if we compare his words here with that which he hath written in the next Section of this Epiſtle before, and with the whole frame and current of of his diſputes, throughout his whole book, we ſhal find that he doth equally with the Papiſts labour to ſettle the people in an <hi>implicit faith</hi> to believe as the Church believeth ſtill. For in the former Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that knoweth beſt his own congregation, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it to <hi>be in the number of thoſe, the greateſt part whereof is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable af underſtanding ſuch controverted points as are treated of in his book.</hi> He ſaith not only that they underſtand them not, but alſo denyeth them to be in a capacity to be brought to the underſtanding of them, <hi>viz.</hi> in their own evidence, therefore they muſt ſtill hold them upon truſt from their <hi>Teachers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides, if we look to the frame of his Diſputes in this Treatiſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167891:31"/> we ſhall find him concurring with the Papiſts, in his indeavours to keep the people in a perpetuall incapacity to underſtand ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in their own evidence. For what elſe can he mean by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a point of divine doctrine in its own evidence, but one of theſe two things, to ſee it in the evidence and cleer teſtimony of the word by which God hath ſet it forth? or to ſee it in the evidence of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical learning and diſputes, by which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whom he followeth, pretend themſelves to ſet it forth? But by neither of theſe will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or the Popiſh Sophiſters (if they can hinder it) ſuffer the vulgar people to know any Evangelicall truth in its own evidence. Not by the evidence of the Scriptures, by which God hath cleered up, and ſo plainly revealed the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths of ſalvation, that even babes and ſucklings may in good meaſure comprehend them, <hi>Mat. 11. 25. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 26. For here with his Maſters the Romiſh Sophiſters, hee raiſeth vain and diſtracting queſtions, making difficulties where the wiſedom of God hath left none, and ſo puzling weak and tender conſciences, that even what before they had attained by the pure and ſimple light of the word, ſeeing now ſuch a thick fogg of doubts interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they think themſelves to have loſt what light once they had, and ſo ſink into ſadneſs and deſpair, concluding it utterly unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. What zeal Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath thus not only to match, but alſo to exceed all the locuſts of <hi>Rome</hi> in darkning ſuch truths as Chriſt hath in Scripture left cleer and open to all, ſhining in the very Sun-beams of the Goſpel, we ſhall find in examining the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing parts of his Treatiſe. So that in this reſpect he hinders, as much as in him lyeth, his <hi>Kederminſterians</hi> from ſeeing the truth of Chriſt in its own evidence.</p>
                        <p>Nor by the latter (Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſophiſtical way of quenching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of confirming Goſpel-truth) can the vulgar ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to know them in their own evidences, not only becauſe this humane Learning hath no power to ſearch into them, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not to be expected that illiterate men ſhould ever attain any depth in this learning. For if it be true what is generally held by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his ſide, that without great acquaintance with ſchool-learning, the marrow of Divinity can never be effectually pierced into; and what a great Scholler once told <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that one of theſe School-Doctors <hi>John Scotus,</hi> can in no wiſe be underſtood under nine years ſtudy at the leaſt; and what a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> affirmeth, that a man muſt have <hi>Ariſtotles Metaphyſicks ad unguem,</hi> before he can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:167891:32"/> of underſtanding one ſentence of <hi>Scotus;</hi> Farewell then all hope of ſaving knowledg ever to be attained by unſcotified miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idiots, in its own evidence, or by the Miniſteriall help of ſuch Teachers as have crept here below upon the Doctrine of Chriſt his Prophets and Apoſtles, and not had ſo much time and patience as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath beſtowed in the ſublimated ſtudy of <hi>Ariſtotle, Scotus,</hi> and their fellows.</p>
                        <p>But what if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> herein ſpeak the ſame things (may ſome ſay) with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſame in oppoſition to the judgment of all the Reformed Churches, yet this doth not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove that it is ſavouring of error which he here delivereth, except it be manifeſted that he ſpeaketh againſt the Scriptures. Doth the word any where forbid us to take up points of Faith on the credit of our Teachers, though we underſtand not the points which they teach, much leſs can produce any Scriptures ſurely and ſoundly to confirm them?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that the Scriptures are very full and punctuall againſt taking upon truſt of meer men any doctrine to be believed to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Be not ye called Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 23. 10. <hi>q. d.</hi> Dare not any of you to ſuffer any to take up matters in Religion upon your truſt or authority? For there is but one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Mr. whoſe authority is authentick, Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>If Paul or an Angell from heaven preach any other Goſpel to you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. therefore not truſted. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 21. <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God: For many falſe Prophets are gone forth into the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1. When the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Prove all, Try all,</hi> he implyedly forbids to take up any thing on truſt from men. <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, the voyce of a ſtranger they will not hear, for they know not, i. e.</hi> own not the voyce of ſtrangers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 27. They know and own the voyce of Chriſt alone: If any preach with another voyce, another doctrine than that which is originally from Chriſt, they fly from him, explode him. Here is nothing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon truſt but from Chriſt himſelf. <hi>They are built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt being the head corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2. 20. A more noble foundation than the truſt and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men.</p>
                        <p>I might annex many like teſtimonies of divine Scripture to the ſame purpoſe, but to what purpoſe? They are Deceivers, ſuch as the Apoſtle numbreth among <hi>grievous wolves, ſpeakers of perverſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:167891:32"/> things, i. e.</hi> perverters of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that <hi>ſeeke to draw Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them, i. e.</hi> to ſettle men in a Faith upon the authority of their learning, wiſedom, and holineſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Baxter</hi> and his peers are neceſſitated thus to do, if in teaching ſuch doctrines they will draw after them Diſciples; For being deſtitute of the authority of God and his word, if they ſhould not urge men to a credulity upon the authority of men, their doctrine would be hiſſed at as having no authority.</p>
                        <p>To conclude then; the doctrine which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here more than obſcurely holds forth is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Againſt Chriſt, and all the Reformed Churches which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, borrowed of, and owned by the apoſtatized Synagoue of <hi>Rome</hi> only.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Againſt the Scripture, as hath been manifeſted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 It is a doctrine that brings with it an unſetledneſs and inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Faith and Religion. Whoſoever takes it up from Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> credit, muſt be always learning, and never know, be whirled hither and thither with doubts and uncertainties, without any firm ſtation, never attaining reſt. For he that taketh upon truſt from his <hi>Teachers</hi> what to believe and do to be ſaved, will one day be of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and a third of <hi>Cephas,</hi> as his fancy tels him, this or that <hi>Teacher</hi> is moſt worthy to be truſted. In great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> predeceſſor taught not the ſame Juſtification with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and he that ſhall ſucceed him will hold out the ſame grounds and way of juſtification with Chriſt and his Apoſtles which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> declineth. And I know not but either of them may be as worthy of Truſt as himſelf. In what a maze muſt that people then be led, by what turnings and returnings muſt they be dragged forward and backward, who are taught to take up do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines on the truſt of their Teachers? what joy in believing can they ever have, whoſe rule in believing is to be never ſetled in their faith, but to be ſtill wavering? His Diſciples muſt needs be meer weather-cocks, <hi>toſſed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="4">4 It is a doctrine that makes way for all Hereſie, Blaſphemy, and Impiety into the hearts of the people. For when Religion is taken upon truſt from the Teachers, Satan will transform himſelf into an Angel of light, and his Miniſters themſelves into Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, to gain credit and opinion of wiſdom and holineſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167891:33"/> above others among the people, that upon their truſt at laſt the people may ſwallow all falſhoods under the name of Truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall commend to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13-15.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Sophiſticall way and Method of diſpute to obſcure, and not to cleer the truths of the Goſpel, diſcovered: And that therein he imitates the Papists.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IN the former Chapter we have found Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> before his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon his Treatiſe, ſomewhat diſcovering with whom he joyns in opinion, ſo far that we may diſcern and gueſs <hi>ex ungue leonem,</hi> by one little piece of the man, what he is in his whole bulk and frame. It contents him not to be one and the ſame with the Papiſts in his judgment, but that he will next alſo diſcover himſelf to be the ſame with them in their ſlights and artifice, to bring all others into the ſame judgment and opinion with them. That generation of the Popiſh Schoolmen are fitly likened by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in his <hi>Advancement of learning,</hi> to Spiders, which ſpin out their webbs out of their own bowels. So theſe ſpinn all their doctrines in religion out of their own brains, their own reaſon, naming Chriſt ſometimes therein, but rather hiding and darkning the authority of his word, than following it as their leading threed in all their doctrines. All their writings about Evangelicall and ſaving points of knowledg, are but as ſo many webs of their fancy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167891:33"/> to catch and carry away from the purity of Chriſts Goſpel; not ſo many well-ordered threeds of ſacred Scriptures to guide and bring us to him. Who is there of all that have but curſorily read their works, that finds them not conſiſting of large heaps of needleſs and ſuperfluous queſtions, to obſcure the light of the word, and to bring all to the tryall of reaſon, yea ſophiſticall and ſophiſticated reaſon, ſurmounting the reaſon and capacity of the people to comprehend? And theſe queſtions which they ſpin and ſpit out by dozens, yea hundreds &amp; thouſands, as they are moſtly ſuperfluous, vain, uſeleſs, and many of them preſumptuouſly and arrogantly propoſed, about things which the Lord hath kept ſecret in his own boſom, not revealing them by his word: ſo are they oft no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily and audaciouſly by theſe men anſwered and determined out of their Philoſophicall and Metaphyſicall fancies, without one particle of the word to ground their determinations upon. Thus by their queſtionary ſophiſtry they have both obſcured, if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally quenched all true Divinity, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and have foyſted in a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of titular Divinity, that hath nothing of light or life in it, ſuch as the Scripture owns not, from their own reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Compare we now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with theſe, to ſee whether as the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Timothy his own,</hi> or his <hi>naturall ſon in the faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 2. becauſe he walked directly after him in the ſteps of his faith: So Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not alſo declare himſelf the <hi>own and naturall ſonn of theſe ſophiſters,</hi> by walking directly after them in the ſteps of their cunning and ſubtlety to deſtroy the Faith.

                           <hi>Bax.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, at the will of his Father, and upon his own will, being perfectly furniſhed for this work, with a Divine power and perſonall Rigteouſneſs, firſt undertook, and afterward diſcharged this debt [<hi>viz.</hi> mans debt to God] by ſuffering what the Law did threaten, and the offender himſelf was unable to bear.</q>

                              <hi>Bax.</hi> Here we are caſt upon many and weighty and very difficult queſtions. 1 Whether Chriſt did diſcharge this debt by way of ſolution, or by way of ſatisfaction? 2 Whether in his ſuffering and our eſcape, the threatning of the Law was executed, or diſpenſed with? 3 And if diſpenſed with, how it can ſtand with the truth and juſtice of God? 4 And whether ſinners may thence be encouraged to conceive ſome hope of a relaxation of the threatnings in the Goſpell? 5 And whether the faithfull may not fear leſt God may relax a promiſe as well as a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? 6 And whether if the Law be relaxable, God might not have releaſed his Sonn from the ſuffering, rather then to have put him to ſo great torment, and to have freely pardoned the offenders? And <hi>p.</hi> 27. The reſolving of the firſt queſtion depends upon the reſolving of two other queſtions, both great and difficult 1 What it was which the Law did threaten? 2 What it was that Chriſt did ſuffer? Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the judgments of <note n="*" place="margin">He means the Popiſh Doctors ſpecially, for they with him are the Divines.</note> Divines about the former, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Whether <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule and body ſhould have been annihilated and deſtroyed, ſo as to become in ſenſible? 2 Or whether his ſoule ſhould have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeparated from his body, as ours are by death, and ſo be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufferer of the pain? 3 Or if ſo, whether there ſhould have been any reſurrection of the body, after any ſpace of time, that ſo it might ſuffer as well as the ſoul? 4 Or whether ſoul and body without ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould have gone down quick into hell, ar into any place or ſtate of torment ſhort of hell? 5 Or whether both ſhould have lived a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life on earth, through everlaſting, in excluſion from Paradiſe, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Gods fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:167891:34"/> and then be annihilated or deſtroyed? 7 And if ſo, whether his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on earth ſhould have been more than men do now endure? And the more importance are theſe queſtions of, becauſe of ſome others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them: As 1. What death it was that Chriſt redeemed us from? 2 And what death it is that periſhing Infants dye, or that our guilt in the firſt tranſgreſſion doth procure? For it being a ſinn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt covenant only, will be puniſhed with no other death than that which is threatned in that Covenant. And <hi>pag.</hi> 31. Beſides it is needfull to know what life was the reward of that Covenant, that we might know what death was the penalty [and this alſo comes into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about the reward] whether (if he had not fallen) he ſhould after a ſeaſon have been tranſlated into heaven without death, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> or whether he ſhould have lived for ever in this terreſtriall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe without addition of further bliſs to that which he had at his firſt Creation? <hi>And as touching the death which Chriſt ſuffered, whether it were the ſame that was threatned to</hi> Adam? <hi>Pa. 33.</hi> If we take the threatning at its full extent, as it expreſſeth not only the penalty, but alſo its proper ſubject and its circumſtances, then it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable that Chriſt did not ſuffer the ſame that was threatned. For the Law threatned the death of the offender, but Chriſt was not the offender. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have ſuffered for ever, but ſo did not Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> did dye ſpiritually by being forſaken of God, in regard of holineſs, as well as in regard of comfort, and ſo was deprived at leaſt of the chief part of his image, ſo was not Chrſt.</p>

                           <hi>Bax. P. 29, &amp; 30.</hi> Much may be ſaid, this ſeemeth, that is unlikely, one thing probable, another poſſible: But for a finall concluſion, <hi>p. 31.</hi> It is hard to conclude peremptorily [any thing] in ſo obſcure a caſe.</q>
                        <p>And ſo he leaves us ſo wiſe, as if he had ſlept and ſaid nothing. But afterwards recalling himſelf, though he can conclude nothing as to the forementioned particular preparatories to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the queſtion; yet <hi>p.</hi> 35. to the ſubſtance of it in generall he thus anſwereth.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> I canclude then, that in regard of the proper penalty, Chriſt did ſuffer a pain and penalty of the ſame ſort, and of equall weight with that threatned; but yet becauſe it was not in all reſpects the ſame, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction than the payment of the proper debt, being ſuch a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as God might have choſen to accept.</q>
                        <p>I liſt not to quarrel with him about the concluſion, it being not a point mainly controverted between us and the Papiſts. Only who ſees not that he might as eaſily have thus concluded, without medling with ſo many frivolous and arrogant queſtions, leaving them where he found them, as not giving the leaſt fulture to ſuch a concluſion? And when he hath thus determined the queſtion, they that lock up to themſelves his Concluſion as a treaſure, ſhall gaine ſo much by it as he that rejoyceth of a chip in his pottage. Poſſibly it may do no hurt, but certainly it will do no good to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>But the anſwer to the ſecond queſtion comes without the help or puſh of a leaver to heave it after, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the threatning was executed, or relaxed and diſpenſed with?</p>

                        <p>And a little further Conference with theſe Diviners rather than Divines (it ſeemeth) would make him of their minds. And ſo the anſwer to the queſtion depends upon ifs, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> change his mind, his anſwer muſt fall after him.

                        <p>Lo the anſwer to the former queſtion is ſtuck ſo deep in the mire, that the beſt Team in Worceſterſhire cannot draw it out.

                           <hi>B.</hi> Concerning the juſtice of God the queſtion is not difficult, and I ſhall ſay nothing to that.</q>
                        <p>See, he is half out of the labyrinth already, and never moves a finger for it. O rare dexterity! It coſts a little more labour to get free from the other half, and thus de doth it.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> The queſtion is, how to reconcile this diſpenſation with Gods truth? Here you muſt diſtinguiſh, 1. Betwixt the letter of the Law and the ſenſe. 2. Betwixt the Law and the end of the Law. 3. Between a threat with exception, either expreſſed or reſerved, and that which hath no exception. 4. Between a threatning which only expreſſeth the deſert of the ſinn, and what puniſhment is due, and ſo falleth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the will of precept; and that which alſo intendeth the certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of event, and ſo falleth under the will of purpoſe alſo.</q>
                        <p>And now I Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>1. The end of the Law is the Law, and that being the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods juſtice, and hatred of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was fulfilled,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:167891:36"/> and therefore the Law was fulfilled <note n="a" place="margin">Let the Judg of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes then chide, and lay by the feet a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer for an hour, declaring therby his juſtice and hatred of the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. M. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be a juſt Judg, &amp; to have fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Law, if hereupon he forth-with diſcharge him.</note>. 2. Moſt think that the threatning had this reſerved exception. <hi>Thou ſhalt dye, i. e.</hi> by thy ſelf or thy ſurety: and though it be ſinfull for man to ſpeak with mentall reſervations, when he pretends to reveal his mind, yet not in God, becauſe as he is ſubject to no law, ſo he is not bound to reveal to us all his mind, nor doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretend any ſuch thing. 3. So that the ſenſe of the ſame is fulfilled. 4. But the ſpecial anſwer that I give is this, when threatnings are meerly parts of the Law, and not alſo predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the event, and diſcoveries of Gods purpoſe thereabouts, then they may be diſpenſed with without any breach of truth. For as when God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat of the tree,</hi> &amp;c. the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is only, It is thy duty not to eat, and not eventually that he ſhould not eat. So when he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> the meaning is, Death ſhall be the due reward of thy ſin, and ſo may be inflicted for it at my pleaſure; and not that he ſhould certainly ſuffer it in the event <note n="b" place="margin">This Doctrine wipes off all feare from ſcandalous ſinners having this plea put into their mouth by Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> God hath ſaid, thou ſhalt not ſo offend but his meaning is not that I ſhould eventually abſtain, and hath ſaid, Thou ſhalt be condemned, not meaning eventually to execute it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I may go on in ſin without fear.</note>.</p>

                        <p>Here he mentioneth 3. opinions; the firſt he utterly explodeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the imputation of Chriſts active obedience unto Juſtification. The ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the efficacy of Chriſts ſufferings to make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the juſtice of God for our ſinns, whereupon we are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and conſtituted righteous in the ſight of God, he kindly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and paſſeth ſome plauſible Complements upon it, and ſo Bids it farewell, without any purpoſe to be in love or familiarity with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:167891:40"/> it. And then takes up the third as beſt agreeing with the end he drives at, though in ſubſtance it be the ſame with the firſt which he ſhook off and trampled under foot with great defiance as the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of abſurdities.</p>
                        <p>What my judgment (as to the two former) is, I need not here expreſs, becauſe it is not a queſtion controverted between us and the Papiſts. It is a queſtion not of very long ſtanding. Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> in his Expoſition of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by appropriating the ſeverall parts of Chriſts righteouſneſs to make up the ſeverall parts of Juſtification, gave the occaſion of the diſpute, as I conceive. And the difference hath hitherto made no breach of communion and amity between ſtable and able Divines or Chriſtians. Nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that hold for the active righteouſnes alſo, there have bin and are ſtill at preſent not a few ſo learned and pious, that it would be no diſparagement to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and my ſelf to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as their <hi>Amanuenſes.</hi> And therefore I queſtion the truth of that accuſation which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> layeth on Mr. <hi>Walker, pag.</hi> 53. (whom he principally not only meaneth, but alſo nameth, when he tells us of <hi>ignorant men, that are ſtrong revilers, and weak diſputers,</hi> reproaching them for hereticks that diſſent from them in judgment. I doubt much that Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> main end here in declaiming againſt Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> is to Apologize for himſelf, and that his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> is, becauſe he finds the ſtroaks which M. <hi>Walker</hi> levelled againſt Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> do now more wound Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> than they did Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> then. I remember I once ſaw that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tractate of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in a friends houſe, and read curſorily ſome part of it, in which he charged Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> with <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi> But if my memory fail me not (as too oft it doth) it was not upon this ſcore, that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> maintained Juſtification by the Paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt only, but upon this, that he upheld the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot deny but this opinion was firſt broached by <hi>Socinus,</hi> and afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by <hi>Arminius.</hi> But becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath taken it up from them, end ſpeaks it out in this his Tractate, more in the full of the mouth, than Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had done, (as wee may ſee afterward) Therefore to prevent the like imputation of <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> hereſie to himſelf, by his chafe againſt Mr <hi>Walker,</hi> he affrights all from charging him therewith. And yet howſoever he ſeemeth to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:167891:40"/> decline ſuch an imputation, who ſeeth not that he will, yea doth more readily take up a curſed Hereſie from any of theſe learned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters, then a bleſſed truth from ſuch ignorant and unſtudied Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that glory in nothing but the fooliſhnes of Chriſts Croſs, and dare not to be wiſe unto ſalvation, beyond the rule of the Goſpel?</p>
                        <p>Hence he paſſeth to his third opinion, which is wholly one with<note place="margin">Page 54.</note> the firſt in ſubſtance, and a little d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what is the difference betwixt the opinion which he ſpewes out as filth and garbage, and that which he ſucks and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as the bread of life, and food from heaven? Forſooth, this only, that the one opinion makes the active righteouſnes of Chriſt, together with his paſſive, to be imputed to us for righteouſnes; the other makes the active, together with the paſſive righteouſnes of Chriſt, ſatisfactory to Gods juſtice, to put us into the participation of Righteouſnes or Juſtification. A vaſt difference in ſenſe, no leſſ then that was, between <hi>Doctor Martin, and Doctor Luther,</hi> or that which one put betwixt the operation and working of <hi>Pepper,</hi> that it was hot in the one, but cold in the other. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Baxter</hi> knowes that the moſt judicious Aſſertors of the firſt opinion, urge no further then to have it granted, that the active as well as the paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, is meritorious to our redemption and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That they are but the more inconſiderate ſort that will have it ſo imputed, that we ſhould be accounted before God as thoſe that have fulfilled all the righteouſnes and duties of the Law, in and by Chriſt fulfilliing the ſame. Therefore his taking up this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as a third opinion, under the name of truth, is but a taking up again as holy and ſavory, that which before he had rejected as the embryon of ignorant and unſtudied brains, full of the greateſt abſurdities.</p>

Should I demand, how it came to paſſe that ſo Eagle-eyed a man ſo long doted upon a cloud, in ſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> and by what means his eyes were at laſt opened, that he ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and ſhunned it?

And how hard a thing is it for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſo great an admirer and adorer of humane wit and learning, to meet with a brave Sophiſter indeed, and not to cloſe in judgement with him, though a Papiſt, an Apoſtate, and more then a Semi-Atheiſt? ſo far do acute and fine-ſpun diſtinctions prevail with him, more then the honourable Authority of the plain word of God. 2 It is moſt probable that during theſe ten years Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> held Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith onely according to the Scriptures, and judgement of the Orthodox Churches, therefore ſtuck ſo long to the Doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſts ſole paſſive obedience, as cohering very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly therewith. But ſince he hath caſt himſelf into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Popiſh Writers, and thence derived Juſtification by works, it concern'd him to caſt off his former Opinion, for the ſole paſſive righteouſnes, as being much repugnant to Juſtification by works, and to take up this as authentick, and ſomewhat conducing and helpfull to his Cauſe. For if Chriſts active obedience ſhould not be held meritorious and ſatisfactory to God, with what face could Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> attribute a prevalency and power herein to our beſt works and actions?

                        <p>IN this ninth Theſis, and its Explication, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hewes out crooked timber enough for many of the diſcreeteſt Divines to employ their time and labour therein, until they are tired, and yet they ſhall not be able at laſt to ſtraighten it. It is like <hi>Pandera's</hi> box, which being opened, let out all miſeries and miſchiefs into the world, as the Poets feign. Whatſoever the Papiſts teach of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and maimednes of Chriſts, and of the neceſſary ſupplies of mans ſatisfaction to be made unto God, of Purgatory, of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Salvation, and many other errors depending upon theſe, are all couched and compaſſed here within a very narrow circuit, ſome expreſſed, and ſome implyed. But ſo that while he haſteth to bind together ſuddenly (that he may not be ſeen) ſo much dreggiſh Popery in one fardle, in his greateſt haſt he leaves not his wits behind him, but craftily delivers to us Papiſticall Doctrine, yet not in the Papiſts words, leſt he ſhould be eſpyed and ſhunned. Thus run his words.</p>

                           <p>A compleat and profound anſwer, who ſo ſtupid or way-ward, that he reſteth not ſatisfied with it? The Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the redeemed are immediately upon the price paid delivered from any of the curſe of the Law, if not from all?</hi> He anſwers, in this caſe the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of ſatisfaction had the ſame immediate effects upon <hi>Adam,</hi> as the ſatisfaction it ſelf, upon us, or for us: But what were thoſe immediate effects upon <hi>Adam?</hi> He anſwereth, a riddle, unriddle what this is, what theſe effects are, <hi>&amp; eris mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> ſuch a one ſhall have a Temple built unto him, from which to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and reſolution to all other queſtions and doubts in Divinity, Oracularly. And who more deſerving of this honour, then Mr. <hi>Baxter?</hi> Who more able to unriddle his own Queſtion, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? That he therefore may be taken for the Divine indeed, he ſo reſolveth the Queſtion, as his own words above declare. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> forthwith received upon Chriſts underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make ſatisfaction for them, is the moſt remarkable imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effect of Chriſts death, whereof the redeemed partake. But the ſuſpenſion of the rigorous execution of the ſentence of the Law, was the benefit that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> upon ſuch undertaking of Chriſt for them, forthwith received. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The ſuſpending of the rigorous execution of the ſentence of the Law, is the moſt obſervable imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effect of Chriſts death, whereof the redeemed partake. The Propoſition he proveth thus, becauſ there were none els exiſtent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when Chriſt ſo undertook; therefore the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his ſatisfaction muſt be upon them, or upon none. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption he takes to be clear by its own light, onely he addeth, that this ſuſpending was a kind of deliverance.</p>
                           <p>If this be not the ſum and force of his anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>Capiat qui capere potis eſt,</hi> I muſt plead my ſelf not guilty of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him. But it is enough evident that this is his meaning. Now if I liſted to anſwer his Argument, I ſhould tell him that both premiſſes labour of one and the ſame fallacy, which is in Schools termed <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> an aſſuming of that as granted, which is in Queſtion. The validity of both Propoſitions depending upon theſe begg'd Principles, that Chriſt firſt undertook to make ſatisfaction to God for the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> when they were exiſtent, and that they were in the number of the redeemed ones, as ſoon as they had ſinned, for ſo was the Queſtion, whether the redeemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are freed from any of the Curſe of the Law? Now what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> goes about to prove, he doth it by the example of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167891:43"/> is in no wiſe a competent proof, unleſs they be proved firſt to have been exiſtent when Chriſt undertook to ſatisfie, and ſecondly to have been then redeemed. For the moſt obſervable effects of Chriſts death pertain to the redeemed, not to the world. Both propoſitions then being faulty, the Concluſion is not worth a button In charity indeed we do not in any wiſe queſtion the redemption and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our firſt parents, (though the time of their converſion be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable whether before the curſe inflicted) But not the judgment of charity, but the undeceiving word of God muſt be made the ground of our Faith. Untill therfore he bring ſome proof of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were exiſtent when Chriſt undertook then alſo and redeemed, in all that he ſaith, he ſaith nothing.</p>
                           <p>Yet becauſe this ſtill leaveth <hi>ſub judice litem,</hi> and certain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions cannot be inferred upon premiſſes left uncertain. I ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſecondly, That the Curſe pronounced and inflicted upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> related to him not as a private but publike perſon. For ſo he fell, and ſo was he ſentenced. As comprehending the Elect, he had the bleſſing of the ſeed of the woman, but as repreſenting thoſe that periſh, ſo he had the Curſe. But touching thoſe things which he and the other godly do ſuffer, the learned <hi>Sadeel (Adver ſus humanas ſatisfactiones</hi>) anſwereth this Popiſh Argument here propoſed by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> out of <hi>Auguſtine. Poſſet aliquis dicere,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine) Si propter peccatum Deus dixerit homini, In ſudore vultus tui edes panem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; ſpinas &amp; tribulos proſeret tibi terra,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cur fideles poſt peccatorum remiſſionem eoſdem dolores patiuntur?

Why do the beleevers after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinns ſuffer theſe ſorrowes? We anſwer (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) Before remiſſion theſe are puniſhments of ſinns, after remiſſion they are tryalls and exerciſes of the Righteous. Whereunto <hi>Sadeel</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Non ſequitur, ſi mors &amp; vitae praeſentis aerumnae per ſe ſunt peccati poenae, quippe propter peccatum in mundum ingreſſae; eas eſſe proptereà pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum paenas ipſis etiam fidelibus, quibus peccata ſunt propter Chriſtum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donata. i. e.</hi> It followeth not if death and the ſorrows of the preſent life be in themſelves the puniſhments of ſinn, becauſe they entred into the world for or by means of ſinn; that they are therefore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of ſinn to the very faithfull alſo, to whom their ſinns are forgiven for Chriſts ſake.</p>

                           <p>But to do him a pleaſure ſhould we give him his Argument, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the unſoundnes of it; what doth he conclude? Thus much that the ſuſpending of the rigorous execution of the ſentence of the Law is the moſt obſervable immediate effect of Chriſts death, that the redeemed of the Lord partake of. By ſuſpending the rigorous execution of the Law, he means, that he doth forbear an hour or a day, or ſome ſhort time, to deſtroy their lives and caſt their ſouls into hell: But ſo that every moment they muſt ſtand in expectation of it, and that to their greater torment at laſt, as their ſinns during the time of the ſuſpenſion is increaſed. Whoſoever now of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones receives comfort by this doctrine, will (I doubt not) give his verdit for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> having ſo nobly and divinely reſolved this queſtion; that He is a Divine indeed.</p>
                           <p>He tells us there be other effects of Chriſts death, &amp;c. But he is not at leiſure now to communicate them. But if they have no more ſweet and marrow than this, let him keep them to himſelf, we will not be inquiſitive after them.</p>

                           <p>Very ſhort, yet not ſo ſweet as ſhort. He ſaith it, but he proves it not.

But Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> purpoſeth to ſpeak more largely hereunto in another place, which will give me occaſion to enlarge my anſwer.

I confeſs we have here a knotty queſtion; The common judgment is, that Chriſt hath taken away the whole Curſe (though not the ſuffering) by bearing it himſelf; and now they are onely Afflictions of Love, and not puniſhments. I do not contradict this Doctrine, through affectation of ſingularity, the Lord knoweth; but through conſtraint of judgment; and that upon theſe grounds following.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 It is undeniable that Chriſts taking the Curſ upon himſelf did not wholly prevent the execution upon the offender. <hi>Ge.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>

                              <p n="3">3 The Scripture tells us that we all dye in <hi>Adam,</hi> (even that death from which we muſt at the Reſurrection be raiſed by Chriſt,) 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15. 21, 22. And that death is the wages of ſin. <hi>Ro.</hi> 6. 23. and that the ſickneſs and weakneſs and death of the godly, is cauſed by their ſins. 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 11. 30, 31. And if ſo, then doubtles they are in execution of the Law, though not in full rigour.</p>

What Reaſon can be given why God ſhould not do us all that good without our ſufferings which now he doth by them, if there were not ſin and wrath and law in them?

                              <p n="8">8 All thoſe Scriptures and Reaſons that are brought to the contrary, do prove no more but this, that our afflictions are not the Rigorous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, that they are not wholly or chiefly in wrath; but as the common love of God to the wicked is mixt with hatred in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the hatred prevaileth above the love; ſo the ſufferings of the godly proceed from a mixture of Love and Anger, and ſo have in them a mixture of good and evill; But the Love overcometh the Anger, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the good is greater than the evill, and ſo death hath loſt its ſting, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15. 55, 56. There is no unpardoned ſin in it which ſhall procure further judgement, and ſo no hatred though there be anger.</p>
                              <p n="9">9 The Scripture ſaith plainly that death is one of the enemies that is not yet overcome, but ſhall be laſt conquered. 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15. 26. And of our corruption the caſe is plain.</p>

Scriptures and Arguments from ſcripture produced by the Proteſtants to prove. 1 That Beleevers are not ſubject to the Curſe: <hi>2ly,</hi> That their ſufferings have not the wrath and hatred, but the love of God in them, are not vindicatory judgments but Chastigatory tryalls.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>LEt us now a little more fully ſtate the queſtion, by ſhewing wherein that which Mr. <hi>B:</hi> calleth the Common judgment, and that which is his own (pretendedly at leaſt) private judgment, do conſent together, and wherein they differ either from other, and ſo we ſhall avoyd all impertinencies and ſtrife about words, which are beſides the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>It is agreed then on both ſides,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the Curſe is the penalty, or the revenging Judgment, or an effect of Gods revenging wrath, by the execution whereof he taketh ſatisfaction to his juſtice upon Tranſgreſſors for the breach of his Law; ſo Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes it out, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the juſtice of God is ſo fully ſatisfied by bearing this Curſe or penalty, as by a complete fulfilling of all the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Law requireth, <hi>p.</hi> 48, 50.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That the Lord Chriſt hath undertaken and made full ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God for all the ſinnes of beleevers, bearing the curſe due to them, and paying (if not the <hi>idem</hi> according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> yet) the <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem</hi> that their debt did amount to.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That God reſteth as fully ſatisfied with this ſatisfaction of Chriſt, as if it had been made perſonally by the beleevers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe two laſt Mr. <hi>B:</hi> ſo frequently aſſerteth that there is no need to quote the places.</p>
                        <p>To which I may add, 5 That Afflictions are incident to the beleevers as well as to the unbeleevers, ſo that <hi>Love and hatred are not diſcernable</hi> to the lookers on, <hi>by that which befalls men in this life, Eccle.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                        <p>6 That theſe afflictions have in them a ſmart and bitternes, as they befall the very Saints, ſo that oft-times in their apprehenſion the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:167891:45"/> very wrath and curſ of God ſeemes to be in them. Theſe two things we grant Mr. <hi>B:</hi> ſo that hitherto the judgements conſent. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                        <p>The difference then betwixt him and us conſiſts principally in theſe two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Whether when Chriſt hath by doing their law, paying their debt, and bearing their curſe, ſatisfied the juſtice of God for the ſinns of beleevers; when God hath accepted the ſatisfaction given, when the beleevers have by faith apprehended and laid hold on it: They do yet remain liable to the curſe of the Law in whole or in part to be inflicted upon them?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Whether the afflictions which God inflicteth upon beleevers in this life, are the effects of Gods revenging juſtice, the Curſe which the law threateneth, and ſo conſequently whether after that God hath taken ful ſatisfaction from Chriſt, he doth in whole or in part require and take ſatisfaction from them alſo; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> mainteins the affirmative of both theſe queſtions, we the Negative: He that 1 after Chriſt hath born the Curſe of the law for beleevers, they are liable to beare it in whole or in part themſelves alſo. And 2 that the afflictions which they ſuffer are from the revenging juſtice of God, the effects and Curſe of the Law, vindictive puniſhments of ſin, full of the wrath of God; as in this his anſwer to the 3 queſtion he declares himſelf. But we utterly deny both theſe propoſitions, either that the beleever is any more after his union to Chriſt, ſubject to the Curſe, or that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which he ſuffereth have the Curſe of the law and reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice of God in them, but proceed (not from the wrath of an angry judge, but) from the tender grace and love of a moſt wiſe and indulgent Father. Both theſe aſſertions we ground upon evident Teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that beleevers are no more liable to, but wholly freed from the Curſe, we have the Holy Ghoſt affirming, <hi>Gal. 3. 13, 14. Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the law, being made a Curſe for us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit, through faith.</hi> What can be ſaid more cleer and full to the Confirmation of our aſſertion, or refuting of Mr. <hi>Baxters?</hi> The Holy Ghoſt ſaith not, Chriſt hath purchaſed to us a liberty for the future that in time we may be delivered from the Curſe, but he hath redeemed us, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined a preſent freedome for us, from the Curſe of the Law. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:167891:46"/> how? <hi>being made a curſe for us.</hi> He hath made preſent payment that we might have preſent deliverance. Even as a ſurety making full ſatisfaction to the Creditor for the principalls debt, obteins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for him a preſent diſcharge from his obligation: not that he ſhall be for a ſeaſon liable to arreſts and impriſonments, and after much fear and ſufferings in this kinde, be at laſt diſcharged. This were enough, but the wiſdome of the Holy Ghoſt proceeds yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to evidence this truth, and to ſtop every mouth that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to open it ſelf againſt it. That the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come [even] upon the Gentiles [beleeving] <hi>viz.</hi> the promiſe of the Spirit, or Spirit promiſed, by faith. All muſt acknowledg that the entrance of the bleſſing, and removeall of the Curſe by the vertue of Chriſts death, are <hi>coaetanea,</hi> of one time and ſtanding. But the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which is the receiving of the Spirit, is actually and oft in the beleevers own ſpirituall feeling, exiſtent and working in him aſſoon as by faith he is united to Chriſt. Therefore alſo aſſoon as he is united to Chriſt, he is actually freed from the Curſe of the Law. Again, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> It will not be denyed here that condemnation is either put for or includeth in it the puniſhment to which the offenders are adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or condemned, and ſo the meaning of the words muſt be this: that there is remaining, no curſe, no vengeance, to which they that are in Chriſt might be condemned; nor any ſentence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge or condemn them to it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath born both for them, and in thier ſtead. This is fully confirmed in the ſecond verſe, but I forbear to annex it, becauſe it is capable of many interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would be too long here to inſert, but all tending to the Confirmation of this truth laid down in the firſt verſe. And if there be no condemnation, no vengeance, no curſe to which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſubject, than are they freed from the Curſe as well in its parts as in the whole. So <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> In what reſpects ſhall not Sin have dominion over beleevers? It is expreſſed partly <hi>ver. 12. It ſhall not ſo reign that they ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> And more fully before <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 21. It ſhall not ſo reign, as formerly it hath reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto death, <hi>i. e.</hi> to expoſe them to the curſe and wrath. Why? Becauſe <hi>they are not under the law but under grace.</hi> The law denounceth and Gods revenging juſtice inflicteth the Curſe, yet upon none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them which are under the law. But beleevers, having done their law in and by Chriſt, come no more under the dominion of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:167891:46"/> the law to be curſed by it, but ever after they are in Chriſt, they are under Grace, at the diſpoſition and under the diſpenſation of Gods grace, from which all bleſſings, but no curſe hath its derivation. No leſs abſurd therefore is it to ſay, that beleevers are liable to the Curſe, than to affirm that the Curſe is an effect of Gods grace, and not of his revenging juſtice. And is there any thing leſs to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from thapoſtle, affirming <hi>Col. 2. 14. That Chriſt hath blotted out that Hand-writing of ordinances which was againſt us, and contrary to us, and taken it away, nailing it to his Croſs.</hi> What was there in that hand-writing of Gods lawes and ordinances, more againſt us and contrary to us than the curſe? but this th'apoſtle affirms Chriſt to have blotted out, cancelled, crucified, in reſpect of any further pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that it can challenge over the Saints. Or when the promiſe of God is thus gone forth, I <hi>will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſinns and their iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. Who will give any other interpretation to theſe words but this, that God will not be wanting in his grace to remember the iniquitie of beleevers to purg them from it, yet he will never more ſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, as to inflict the curſe and wrath upon them for it? Not to heap up ſcriptures beyond meaſure to this purpoſe, I ſhal conclude with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba, Father,</hi> When was their time of bondage and fear, but when they were under the law? or what did they fear, but the curſe, death, and wrath, which the law threatned? But now being in Chriſt, &amp; freed from the law, they have received together with a new Condition or relation a new Spirit, a Spirit not of fear but of Confidence, not of fear, becauſe they have a freedom from the law and curſe which before held them <hi>all their life time in fear:</hi> but of Confidence, becauſe that being in Chriſt they are adopted to be the children of God, no more to fear the curſe from him as a Judge, but to dwell upon his mercies as the mercies of an indulgent Father.</p>
                        <p>Enough for the confirmation of the firſt aſſertion, and in all that hath been ſaid, there is nothing of the fallacies and querks of mans wit and learning, but the very demonſtration of the Spirit by the word. The proof of the ſecond is included in this. If true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not obnoxious and liable to the Curſe and wrath of God, it muſt follow by neceſſary Conſequence, that then the afflictions and ſorrowes which befall them here, are no parts of the Curſe or effects of Gods vindicative juſtice upon them. But further to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:167891:47"/> that they are fruits of Gods love, and diſcending from the grace of God, I ſhall annex ſome Scriptures that give their ſuffrage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5.-8. may ſtand in ſtead of all, in which the Apoſtle doth ſo fully diſpute and determine this queſtion, as if it had been in his dayes Controverted. He will not have us to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that exhortation which ſpeaketh unto us as to children; My ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. If ye endure chaſtening God dealeth with you as with ſonnes, for what ſon is he whom he chaſteneth not? But if ye are without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, ye are baſtards and no ſonnes.</hi> Three Arguments eminent above the reſt we here receive from the hand of the Apoſtle, full to our purpoſe. 1 He calls the afflictions of the Saints Chaſtenings or Chaſtiſements, not puniſhments or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſinuating that the troubles which they ſuffer, <hi>toto coelo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt,</hi> have a vaſt difference from thoſe which fall upon the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Chaſtiſements tend to the amending, ſpirituallizing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of thoſe that are exerciſed therewith, as appeareth by the 11 verſe of this Chapter. But the judgments which proceed from the Law and revenging juſtice of God, work to the tormenting and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall deſtruction of them upon whom they are inflicted. 2 He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes them to have their riſe from that new relation unto God whereunto by faith they are advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Children of God. They that are not Children undergo in their afflictions the vengeance of God, But the Children are under the ſweet diſcipline and loving Chaſtiſements of a Father, a moſt wiſe and moſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Father that ſeeks and in all his diſcipline worketh for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, not for the deſtroying of his Children, <hi>judgeth,</hi> i. e. Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, and by correction holds <hi>them</hi> in from evill and apoſtacy, <hi>that they may not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. 3 He pronounceth their troubles to the effects of Gods love, <hi>whom he loveth, he chaſteneth,</hi> &amp;c. but the Curſe and revenging judgments of the Law proceed from his hatred. The Law brandiſheth its Curſe againſt enemies whom God hateth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. not againſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his boſom, of his love. <hi>Againſt theſe there is no law,</hi> i. e. no power in the law to Curſe and Condemn, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18, 23. Or when the Holy Ghoſt Calleth the afflictions of beleevers, <hi>Tryalls, fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,</hi> ſuch as is the <hi>tryall of the gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 12. doth he not denote a Contra-diſtinct difference between the afflictions of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:167891:47"/> and the unbeleevers? Men caſt wood and ſtubble into the fire to Conſume them, but the gold and ſilver into the fornace, to try, refine, and purifie them, that they may be of precious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable uſe to them. The one they caſt from themſelves, the other they fit for their uſe and ſervice that they may never be loſt. Such difference is there betwixt the fire of the curſe into which God caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked from himſelf to be devoured, and the fiery tryall, or fire of tryall, into which he caſteth his Saints for the further purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfecting of their faith and ſanctification, that they may become veſſels of honour in his houſe for ever. And when the Scripture ſpeaketh ſo oft of <hi>Rejoycing in afflictions,</hi> pronouncing it the duty of Chriſtians ſo to do; as <hi>Mat. 5. 11, 12. Col. 1. 24. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. is it not implyed that their ſufferings are altogether flowing from and diſpenſed by the grace and love of God. For who can or ever was directed by the holy Ghoſt to rejoyce in the wrath of God, or in the effects of Gods wrath againſt him, ſuch as are the curſe and vengeance? Or when the Lord Chriſt affirmes the eternall Father to be the <hi>Husbandman of his Vineyard the Church,</hi> uſing his hook to cut off and <hi>caſt away the fruitles branches,</hi> i. e. the falſe Chriſtians, but his pruning knife to better &amp; perfect the fruitfull branches, <hi>i. e.</hi> the true beleevers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2. Doth not this declare his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be in hatred and defiance to the one, but in love and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the other, even when he pruneth and woundeth them? And when the promiſe of God is gone forth in relation to the beleevers, not to exempt them from, but to ſupport them in, and bleſs unto them all their ſufferings; <hi>when they paſs thorow the waters, to be with them, and thorow the Rivers, that they ſhall not overflow them, when they walk thorow the fire, they ſhall not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon them,</hi> Iſa. 43. 2. Surely theſe waters and fires are not the curſe as the cauſe, in which God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>l ſo accompany and perfect them, but as his preſerving them in it, ſo his leading them into it, is from his love and not from his hatred. From all which we may boldly conclude, that the ſufferings which befall beleevers in this life, are not the penalty or Curſe of the Law, or any part of it, nor yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Gods revenging juſtice: but fatherly Chaſtiſements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the love and Grace of their heavenly Father.</p>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ten Arguments for the contrary aſſertions exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and anſwered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO the ten Arguments of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> by which he goeth about to fortifie his two contrary aſſertions, I anſwer in their order. To the firſt drawn from Gods dealing with our firſt parents, I have anſwered before. He muſt firſt prove theſe two things; firſt, that they were beleevers, which a meer and dark promulgation of a Saviour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. doth not evince, (for many thouſands have had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel more fully and cleerly preached to them, yet have continued in unbeleef) Secondly, that the ſufferings to which his quotations direct, were inflicted upon them as a Curſe by Gods revenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and untill he hath proved both theſe, his Argument is beſides the queſtion. It being not denyed by that which he calls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgement, either that unbeleevers are under the Curſe, or that beleevers are ſubject to ſufferings, though not to the Curſe; but a full anſwer to this Argument was given before out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Sadeel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that it laboreth of the ſame fallacy with the former. That the wicked feel all thoſe ſorrowes that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, and bear the curſe and hatred of God in them, is not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the godly have their part in the ſame ſorrowes, yet they bear not the curſe and hatred of God therein. This he was to have proved, and untill he hath proved it, he ſaith nothing but ſlides from the queſtion; which (if he will but look an inch backward to his own words) he thus ſtateth. That the Common judgment is that Chriſt hath taken away the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ole Curſe, being made a Curſe for us, yet exerciſeth his own people with ſufferings, which unto them are onely afflictions of love, &amp;c. Againſt this opinion he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf, undertaking to prove that theſe alſo have not onely their ſufferings, but alſo the Curſe of God in their ſufferings. Now the ſecond argument which he brings to prove this, is that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the ſame things which are inflicted upon the wicked as a curſe. What is this to the purpoſe? he doth herein but beat the ayr, and fight againſt the winde, and bark at the Moon, comes not neer them whom he makes his adverſaries in this queſtion. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſufferings, but deny the curſe. He muſt therefore prove that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:167891:48"/> the curſe as the curſe, is inflicted upon the Saints, els he comes no neerer the queſtion, than, <hi>Ararim Parthus bibit aut Germania Tigrim.</hi> For all that is here ſaid denyeth not all the ſufferings of the Saints to be chaſtiſements and afflictions of love. What the Apoſtle ſaith of one of them is true of the reſt alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> womens bringing forth of their children in ſorrow. <hi>Shee ſhall be ſaved by childbearing,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 15</note> is the Originall, though our Tranſlation hath it [and not by] childbearing, if <hi>ſhee continue in faith and charity, and holines with ſobriety.</hi> The meaning is (notwithſtanding the Popiſh falſe gloſſe given it) that although ſorrow in Childbearing was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon that ſexe as a part of Gods Curſe for ſin, yet as many as beleeve ſhall finde the Curſe removed, and a bleſſing in the place thereof. It ſhall be made a happy furtherance to their ſalvation, putting them in minde of their ſin that firſt brought the ſorrow, and ſo filling them with ſelf-deniall and ſelf-abhorring, that they ſhall cleave the faſter to Chriſt for ſalvation by Faith, as knowing themſelves forlorn in themſelves, and ſtand the more fixed and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in charity, holines, and ſobriety. The like is to be concluded of the reſt of the ſufferings which he particularizeth, God ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth them that they may be furtherances of ſalvation to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by working in them humblednes and ſelf-denyall, bearing up themſelves by faith in Chriſt alone, both for ſalvation and increaſe of their ſanctification. The very pravity of our nature of which he ſpeaketh is left in us not as a curſe in wrath, but as a means in Gods wiſdome and love more to humble us, to make us more to cleave unto Chriſt, and an Antagoniſt againſt which fighting in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſpirit of Chriſt we may <hi>overcome,</hi> and having overcome may obtein the Crown. So that theſe two Arguments are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and nothing to the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>To the third, I anſwer that there is nothing els in it but a wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures from their proper ſenſe that they may be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ends. Firſt that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe. It onely teſtifieth <hi>that as by man came death,</hi> i. e. by <hi>Adam, ſo by man,</hi> i. e. by Chriſt <hi>came the reſurrection.</hi> But how far both of the members of this propoſition reach, is manifeſt by the following words. <hi>For as in Adam all dye,</hi> i. e. all that live and die in <hi>Adam</hi> periſh hopeleſly and everlaſtingly: <hi>So in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive,</hi> i. e. All that are tranſlated out of <hi>Adam</hi> into Chriſt. The one man being the root of death to himſelf, and all that are in him: the other the root of life to himſelf, and to all that by faith ſhall be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:167891:49"/> ingraffed into him. That this is the genuine meaning of the words is evident by the next verſe, which amplifieth what th'apoſtle had ſaid in this, <hi>viz.</hi> who are theſe all that ſhall be made alive in Chriſt? Firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as the firſt fruits, then they that are Chriſts at his coming.</hi> Here is no mention of the reſurrection of them that are not in Chriſt. Not that theſe ſhall not alſo be raiſed by Chriſt, but that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here not of reſurrection in generall, but of reſurrection to life, whereof thoſe that are in Chriſt do alone partake: Even as of thoſe which dye in <hi>Adam</hi> he ſpeakes of an everlaſting death, whereof the unregenerate alone partake. So that there is not any mention here expreſſed of the death of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, much leſſe of the curſe and wrath in their death. Touching the ſecond Scripture which he quoteth and citeth, <hi>Rom. 6. 23. The wages of ſin is death:</hi> who doubts but it is ſo to them that are under the guilt and dominion of ſin? But what is this to beleevers? And the third Scripture is as pat as the two former. <hi>For this cauſ many of you are ſick, many weak, many ſleep.</hi> The Apoſtle here writes to a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, in which it appears there were ſome true, and ſome but formall and temporary beleevers. Chriſt is in the midſt of this Church diſpenſing his diſcipline. The true beleevers by the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the formall profeſſors had ſomewhat prophaned the Lords Table by reſorting to it ſomewhat diſorderly. The other had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally violated it by coming to it drunken (and ſo were worſe than beaſts) from their own Tables; here now had Chriſt inflicted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of ſicknes and weaknes for the humbling and amending of thoſe that were his, but death and vengeance upon them that while they profeſſed faith in him, yet were indeed deſpiſers of him and his ordinances. What is this to the Curſe of the Law upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers? Therefore I ſhall add to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> [And if ſo] my [and if ſo,] if ſo that wreſting of Scriptures will ſerve the turn, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will ſurely have the water run in his ground, and his fancy ſtand, though Gods truth thereby fall to the earth.</p>
                        <p>To the fourth. That his phraſe is ambiguous, and it is not eaſily underſtood what ſo cunning a ſophiſter meaneth by <hi>evills.</hi> Untill therefore he hath diſcharged his buſhell of diſtinctions, putting a difference (after his manner) between a naturall and a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall good, whereof this evill is a privation, between an evill phyſicall, and an evill morall, and an evill in a theologicall ſenſe, between the evill of ſenſe and the evill of loſs, and a whole bundle more of evills that he can diſtinguiſh into their kinds, we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:167891:49"/> know not what he meaneth when he ſaith that ſufferings are in their own nature evills to us. If I ſhould anſwer in one ſenſe, he hath the ſlight quickly to evade to another: and to ſtudy out all his evills would coſt more labor than a hundred ſuch Arguments and all his evills to boot are worthy of. As for that which he addeth, <hi>Doubtles ſo far as it is the effect of ſin, it is evill and the effect of the Law alſo.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, doubtles ſo far as the Sun is made or is the effect of a thunder cloud, it is black and dark, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Thunderbolt alſo. We deny it to be the effect of ſin as the meritorious cauſe thereof, ſo that the ſuffering of a beleever ſhould be the curſe or revenging puniſhment of his ſin, [Chriſt hath born that] and ſo it ſhall not be (in this reſpect) evill, nor the effect of the law neither. We grant a beleevers ſin to be oft the occaſion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the proper cauſe of a beleevers ſufferings.</p>
                        <p>To the fifth. We deny not the ſufferings of beleevers to be oft in Scripture aſcribed to Gods Anger. But it is ſo aſcribed, 1 <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> to ſet forth Gods dealings to mans dull underſtanding by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of mans paſſions, that they might be the more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Becauſe man in his anger and wrath doth correct moſt ſeverely, therefore the ſufferings of the Saints when they are great and grievous are ſaid to come from Gods anger, and therefore ſaid to be from his anger, to ſpeak out that they are great afflictions, ſuch as children receive from their parents when they are moſt hot in their paſſion: Not that there is indeed any ſuch paſſion in God. 2 In reſpect of the ſufferers apprehenſion, who being weak in faith and too much prejudiced by ſenſe, is apt for a ſeaſon ſometimes in great tryalls to conclude himſelf to be caſt out of Gods favour, and overwhelmed with his wrath and fury. Not that it is ſo really, For God hath forgiven their ſinns, Therefore after his forgiving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wrath and anger may be aſcribed to malicious men, whom we ſhall hear ſaying, I will forgive but never forget him: But in no wiſe to the moſt righteous God, who <hi>ſo forgiveth</hi> the ſinns of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as that <hi>he will never more remember them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the ſixth. I will not fall into a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a ſtrife and diſpute about words and names. Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> agree with us in the matter, and we will not ſtick to cloſe with him in the name and words; Let him deny all malignity and curſe in the ſufferings of the godly, and to do him a pleaſure we will call them puniſhments as he doth. After that God had new named <hi>Jaakob</hi> calling him <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ever after indifferently called either <hi>Jaakob</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtill, the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167891:50"/> new name made it not a ſin to make uſe of the old alſo. So though the ſufferings of the Saints which under the Law were uſually ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med puniſhments and judgments are now under the Goſpel as it were baptized with new names which more ſet forth their nature, ſuch as are, <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> and <hi>Tryalls;</hi> yet is it no ſin to uſe the old as well as the new names ſtill, for we ſee the penmen of the New Teſtament to have done it before us.</p>
                        <p>To the Seventh. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is here returned again to his evils; and either I underſtand not what his meaning is, or if I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, I find a pack of little ſence, and much arrogance, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of abſurdities and preſumptions, Abſurdities in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, arrogance and preſumption in that which he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the confirmation thereof. Firſt we have his abſurd non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. <hi>The very nature of affliction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to be a loving puniſhment, a naturall evill ſanctified, and ſo to be mixed of evill and good, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from mixt cauſes.</hi> Let him that can, make ſenſe and truth here meet together, I cannot. By evil I muſt needs conjecture he means the evill not of ſin, but of puniſhment. For the evill of ſin, as ſin, cannot be mixt of evill and good, being altogether evill. By af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ever ſince I underſtood words, I have concluded to be meant any vexation, trouble, ſorrow, anguiſh, or torment, that a man hath inflicted upon him by God or the Creature. If this be not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, I never knew affliction. If it be ſo, it is a meer abſurdity to affirm every affliction to be a loving puniſhment, a naturall evill ſanctified, mixed of evill and good, <hi>&amp;c. Pharaoh</hi> afflicted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Devill afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> did either <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or the Devill mean or act love in afflicting? or ſanctifie the evill which they inflicted? or had the evill which they inflicted either love or good in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? who but a man in a dream will affirm any of this gear? It cannot be pronounced and concluded that the afflictions which are from the Creature, as from the Creature, to have ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> aſcribeth to them, either from their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or from the will and infuſion of the Creature inflicting them. And no leſs abſurd is it to attribute ſuch qualifications to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction univerſally as it proceeds from God, either immediately, or mediately by the Creature. The torment of the reprobate men, and Devils in Hell, muſt be granted to be an affliction, and that it is God which afflicts them. To conclude hence becauſe it is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, an affliction from God, it is a loving puniſhment, a ſanctified evill, mixt of good and evill, as proceeding from mixt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:167891:50"/> Cauſes, is ſuch an abſurdity, that although Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in words affirm it, <note n="*" place="margin">

Paragr. 30.</note> yet would he be as loath as any of the oppoſite opinion to try it. If he had ſaid <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> are in their own nature ſo qualified, we ſhould have born with it; but he ſhunneth that word as a rock upon which he might have daſhed the Curſe againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, wherewith as with a treaſure he hath laden the Barque of his diſputation in this place. From ſuch falſe and abſurd premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therefore to inferr this Concluſion [<hi>Therefore to ſay that Chriſt hath taken away the Curſe and evill but not the ſuffering, is a meer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, becauſ ſo far as it is a ſuffering, it is evill to us and the execution of the Curſe</hi>] is as fallacious, as the premiſſes abſurd. Fallacious many ways, 1 in jumbling in the execution of the Curſ, which was neither expreſſed nor implyed in the premiſſes. 2 In couniting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether evill and the curſe as equipollent terms, which are oft diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates. No man beſides Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will conclude every evill of ſuffering to be the Curſe. <hi>Chriſt mourned for the ſins of Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 23. 37. Lu. 19. 42. <hi>Paul had continuall heavineſſe and ſorrow in heart for the unbelief of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9. 2. <hi>Jeremy had his ſoul weeping in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and his eyes running down with teares, for the ſin and afflictions of his people.</hi> Jer. 13. 17. This mourning, heavines, and weeping, were ſufferings, made impreſſion of evill (I mean with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> the evill of pain and ſorrow) upon them, yet were not theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the execution of the Curſe upon them. 3 In an implyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation that we deny all evill of pain in the ſufferings of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſo making them as ſtocks, and ſtones, inſenſible, or as glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, impaſſible. Which none ever held, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would lay it as an abſurdity upon all that diſſent from him, to make the truth which they maintein odious. Now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not a Child, he ſees well enough theſe abſurdities and fallacies, and doth not either thorow ignorance or inadvertency commit them. His uſe of them therefore doth inſinuate to us two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 His abaſing opinion of others in the ſuperlative confidence that he hath of and in himſelf. If he thought not almoſt all others to be meer <hi>Terrae filios,</hi> Clods of clay in compariſon of himſelf, he would not thus ſhake out upon his very abſurdities, and groſſeſt fallacies to be treaſured up by us as Oracles, becauſ his.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 His ſuſpending of conſcience that while he pretends unto truth, yet takes the reines by any abſurd falſe tricks utterly to ſubvert it. As for his arrogance againſt God in the Concluſion, What reaſon can be given, <hi>&amp;c. ut ſupra.</hi> No marvell if he take the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:167891:51"/> chaire to himſelf alone from thence to judge of all other Divines, when we finde him here as it were uſurping the throne of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thence to ſentence and cenſure the wiſedome of God in his proceedings. In anſwer to him I ſhall uſe no other but Mr. <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> words againſt the like arrogance of the Papiſts. Such Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (ſaith he) are vain and curious, proſecuted by idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull men, who not acknowledging the riches of Gods Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Grace, in that courſe of our redemption which God hath followed, would accuſe God of indiſcretion, for making much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Criticiſms upon Gods glorious &amp; wonderfull proceedings in his [adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,] we leave to <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> with their followers.

                        <p>To the Eighth. Becauſe he knoweth his aſſertion falſe, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith ſomething, but conceals from us what it is, tells us that all the Scriptures and reaſons which are brought againſt his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do not hit it nor hurt it, but will not let us to know one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of all thoſe Scriptures and Reaſons that he hath heard or read urged againſt him, leſt that ſome one anſwering might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the falſhood of the aſſertion.

                           </gap>o leave no footing for an anſwer. Such baites may catch Froggs poſſibly, but never a Fiſh. And (as he affirmeth) neither Scriptures not Reaſons prove more then this, That our afflictions are not the rigorous execution of the Law, what Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why that believers ſhall not be damned in hell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with unbelievers? For what is the rigor of the Law but the infliction of the Curſe in its utmoſt extent and extremity. But if the Saints be beaten with few ſtripes when the rebells are beaten with many, and be damned but to the uppermoſt when the other are caſt into the nethermoſt hell, then is not the Curſe of the Law execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them in its utmoſt rigor? If this be not to abaſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt that hath purchaſed, and abuſe the grace of God that promiſeth, and abate if not to deſtroy the hope and comfort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that ſhall receive (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) no better priviledges then this, ſurely then nothing can do it. As for that which he addeth of a mixture of love and hatred in God when he curſeth the wicked; and of love and anger when he curſeth the godly. This is a meer <hi>Chimaera</hi> of his own brain; a making of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:167891:51"/> God to be in a commotion againſt himſelf, to carry fire in the one hand and water in the other; to fight with the right againſt the left, and with the left hand againſt the right: ſometimes the one and ſometimes the other overcoming, but of which ſide ſoever the Victory reſteth, ſtill muſt the poor believer be curſed, and when moſt under the curſe (we muſt believe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> telling us a ſtrange wonder) he is not at all under the hatred of God. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſputer to have ſtood alway at <hi>Marcions</hi> elbow prompting him with argument to prove this God to have been a malignant and envious God, the author of all evill to mankinde; what leſs doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirm when he tells us that he curſeth his very Friends, thoſe that truſt in him, thoſe whom he hateth not, yea thoſe whom he loveth? But doth he bring no Scripture to prove all that he hath ſaid? Yes one in ſteed of all, and that as pertinent and proper to his purpoſe as a Pearl to a Swines ſnout, <hi>Death hath loſt his ſting,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56. <hi>There is no unpardoned ſin in it.</hi> Yet when God hath pardoned every of their ſins, he will nevertheleſſe powre upon them the Curſe, when they are without, if not alſo becauſe they are without ſin, <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> and I muſt be ſilent.</p>
                        <p>To the Ninth. It greeves me leſſe when I finde Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the pure fountain of Scripture, ſtirring in his own element the puddle of humane art and wiſedom, then when he meddles with the word, becauſ he ſeldom toucheth it but with a defiled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing hand to pervert, maim, or add to it and ſo to prophane it. So that his ſin is greater in this than in the other. The place which he quotes here 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. ſaith not that (as he untruly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth) Death is not yet overcome, but onely ſaith <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death;</hi> it is overcome already though not deſtroyed. Yet not to ſtrive about words, Death is overcome, and it is not overcome, but in different reſpects. It is overcome</p>
                        <p n="1">1 In relation to Chriſt himſelf and his naturall body, that it cannot reach or ſeize on him. Els is not Chriſt riſen from death, and <hi>then our faith is vain.</hi> But he is riſen in the power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>having looſed or diſſolved the pains</hi> [and Chains too] <hi>of Death, it being unpoſſible he ſhould be held by it.</hi> Acts 2. 24. For how ſhould a power finite over-power the power of God which is infinite? Neither will any ſay that Chriſt eſcaped from the bonds of death by Treaty, but by Conqueſt. <hi>He aſcended on high, leading captivity captive,</hi> Eph. 4. 8. <hi>Having ſpoyled principalities, and powers, he made open ſhew of them, triumphing over them,</hi> Col. 2. 15. <hi>By his death he hath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:167891:52"/> deſtroyed</hi> not onely death it ſelf, but <hi>him alſo that had the power of death,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Devill,</hi> Heb. 2. 14.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 In relation to the myſticall body of Chriſt, the believers, it is ſo overcome that it hath in it no curſe to vomit out upon them. That was carried away in Chriſts naturall body, that this his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body might be freed from it. <hi>He took to himſelf</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>part of our fleſh and blood, that by death he might deſtroy him that hath the power of death,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Devill, and deliver them who through fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15. What was that in death that the Saints ſo feared under the Law, (before the Goſpel had fully cleered to them their liberty) but the Curſe? The Law threatned them with death as with the Curſe and vengeance of God. This made them to live all their life-time in a ſad bondage for fear of death, of the curſe and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in death at the laſt. But Chriſt hath by his death delivered us from the Curſe that was in death, ſo that now we live not in fear and bondage, in expectation of death. It is but a ſweet dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory to the Saints, in which they put off their <hi>corruptible and dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh,</hi> that at laſt they may <hi>put on immortall and ſpirituall bodies,</hi> in them <hi>to meet with Chriſt in the day of Judgement, and be for ever with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44. 1 Theſ. 4. 17. In theſe reſpects death is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                        <p>But it is not ſo overcome but that it hath its being, yea full dominion with its curſe over the wicked, and in this reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death;</hi> as will appear by reading the former verſ with this, <hi>Chriſt muſt reign till he hath brought all his enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle here from the Authority of that Prophecy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. concludeth that Chriſt muſt <hi>ſit at the right hand of God, having</hi> and executing <hi>all power in heaven and in earth, untill he hath brought all his enemies under his feet.</hi> Here if</p>
                        <p n="1">1 We conſider that death as the other enemies that are to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, is ſpoken of as an Enemy to Chriſt, we muſt conclude that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not at all of death, as a Curſe. For death is no more a Curſe to Chriſt glorified, than the other enemies wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reprobate men that are to be brought under his feet.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 A reaſon is here given why death muſt be the laſt Enemy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt muſt bring <hi>all his enemies under foot.</hi> Now as long as there ſhall remain upon the earth enemies to Chriſt, and his Goſpel, ſucceeding one another in their generations, ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:167891:52"/> long death in its fulneſſe of the curſe and wrath of God, is uſefull to ſeize on them, at the Lord Chriſt ſhall deſtroy and bring them under its power: ſo that as long as there is any other Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, death is not to be aboliſhed in regard of its uſefulneſſe in reſpect of the other Enemies.</p>
                        <p>But when the end is come, and the enemies all deſtroyed, and no one more remaining to be ſeized on, but that all ſhall be raiſed from this firſt to be ſentenc'd unto and hurled into the ſecond death, hell and brimſtone, (I mean all the enemies of Chriſt) now death alſo it ſelf ſhall be deſtroyed, there being no further uſe of it. That this is the proper meaning of this Text a blind man may ſee, and conſequently ſee it to be ſinfully wreſted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> forcing it ſeemingly to prove that the Saints are yet liable to the Curſe, becauſe ſubject to death.</p>
                        <p>To his plain caſe of our Corruption, which he addeth, I have ſpoken before.</p>
                        <p>To the tenth, which is the laſt. Every one will expect to find the ſweet at the bottom, and that the laſt ſtroke ſhould drive the nail home to the very head. Attend we to it therefore conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and we ſhall find it if not the ſtrongeſt, yet the moſt porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of all. <hi>The whole ſtream of Scriptures</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>makes Chriſt to have now the ſole diſpoſing of us and of our ſufferings;</hi> Ergo becauſe we are in Chriſts arms and under his diſpenſation, we muſt needs be liable to the Curſe. For the Scripture affirms him (ſaith he) <hi>to have prevented the full execution of the Curſe, and to manage that which lyeth on us for our advantage and good; but no where doth it affirm that he ſuddenly delivereth us.</hi> Which of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> admirers would not have cenſur'd it in <hi>Bellarmin</hi> a <hi>moſt prodigious impudency, if not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> thus to father his conceits upon the holy Scriptures. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had found but one leaſt rivulet of that whole ſtream of Scriptures which he mentioneth to have been for his turn, would he not have directed us to it, or cited it to us? If he took the holy Scriptures for any thing els then one of his <hi>Fathers</hi> once termed it to Cardinal <hi>Bembus, Fabulam de Chriſto,</hi> he would not dare ſo much to ſlander, wreſt, and corrupt it. While his diſpute is wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the Curſe to bring believers under it, he would fear that Curſe denounced againſt himſelf, <hi>all plagues upon him that ſhall add any thing to it, and the taking away his part from the book of life, whoſoever ſhall take from it,</hi> Rev. 22. 18, 19. what leſs doth Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in pronouncing the whole ſtream of Scriptures, to teach that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:167891:53"/> which no drop of Scripture hath a reliſh of? is not this adding. And when the Scripture pronounceth Chriſt to <hi>have delivered us from the curſe of the Law; that there is no condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. and he comes with his gloſſe, he hath delivered us from the Curſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> hath prevented the full execution of the Curſe. There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>i. e.</hi> none is condemned to the Curſe in its full rigour, among all the beleevers; is not this to take away from the word of God, yea to enervate and emaſculate it and make it of no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour?</p>
                        <p>And further, doth not his Arguing here tend to the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, annihilating, and even un-Chriſting of Chriſt? What an abſurdity is it to think that he <hi>who was God, and accounted it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equall with God, ſhould in overflowing love towards us, make himſelf of no reputation, take to him the form of a Servant, humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 6. - 8. <hi>and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bear our ſins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2: 24. and all to this end, that having diſabled Law and Sin from all power to Curſe without him, to purchaſe to himſelf the Monopoly of Curſing, or inflicting the Curſe upon his own friends, yea his own Body and Members, that none henceforth ſhould curſe them but from by and under him? Who but one that is ambitious to be his Vicar, would make of Chriſt ſuch a Pope? Yea how is the glory of Chriſts grace and merits veiled, nay extinguiſhed, by teaching that Chriſt is aſcended into the Heavens, and ſit down at the right hand of God, to manage the Curſe to the tormenting, yet (if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be heard) for the advantage of his Saints on Earth?</p>

And this occaſioned me to be the more in length to bring forth cleerly into the light the truth that he hath hidden; and to take off the outſide paint from his fancies, that they might appear in their own nature and colors. Partly alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the pernicious danger which lurketh in the doctrine which he hath here delivered, againſt which too much cannot be ſpoken, to prevent the taking of inconſiderate and over credulous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in his ſnares. I ſhall ſhew my reaſons why I call it pernicious doctrine, and ſo leave the queſtion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is anti-ſcripturall and diametrically oppoſite to the word, as is enough manifeſted by that which hath been already ſaid in the examination thereof.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is Antichriſtian, hath ſundry Popiſh errors, ſome more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertly, others more hiddenly included in it. So that when imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his arguments he profeſſeth, that it is not affectation of ſingularity that divides him in judgement from the reformed Churches, we doubt not but he ſpeaks truth herein; For it is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:167891:54"/> the ſtream and Clowd of Popiſh Doctors, whoſe ſophiſtry hath more force upon his judgment than ever I could perceive the Word to have. Thoſe Popiſh errors then that are more openly conteined in his doctrine here are principally about Chriſts and mans ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions made to God for mans ſinns; in which as the Papiſts ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have man to bear a ſhare with Chriſt, that the glory may not be wholly the Lords. And here in ſundry points Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaketh the very ſame things, though not altogether in the ſame words with the Papiſts. I ſhall in theſe ſeverall points, lay down briefly the doctrine of the Papiſts firſt, and then compare Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> with it, that the Coherence betwixt them may be cleerly ſeen. The Papiſts opinions I ſhall truly ſet forth to you, (though brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as they themſelves expreſs themſelves in the Councell of <hi>Trent. Seſſ. 6.

                        <p n="1">1 They hold that although Chriſt hath by his death and merits ſatisfied the Law and Juſtice of God for the fault of our ſinns in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Gods Juſtice and violating his holy Law, ſo that God is no more at enmity with but reconciled to them which truly repent and beleeve, hath fully pardoned their ſinn, and forgiven their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences for Chriſts ſake: yet hath neither Chriſt given nor God taken full ſatisfaction for the puniſhment, but that after the fault is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, God may and will infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ct puniſhment upon the offender. In this and the reſt points of ſatisfaction they give this generall rule, that Chriſt hath undertaken for us onely that which we could not do for our ſelves, and ſatisfied for us ſo far onely as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to make ſatisfaction for our ſelves. As for that which by doing or ſuffering was in our power to accompliſh for our ſelves, that he hath left to be (without his preventing us) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by us. But in this Caſe, ſay they, It was unpoſſible for man to undertake any work any ſuffering ſo noble &amp; worthy as might ſtand in equipoiſe with the offending of ſo infinite a Majeſtie, and ſo to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for the fault. This therfore Chriſt hath done and God hath accepted from Chriſt in our behalf. But it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for man to ſatisfie (at leaſt in part) for the puniſhment which the juſtice and law of God exact for the offence committed. This therefore is in part left to us to ſatisfie; and after he hath forgiven the fault, doth notwithſtanding inflict upon us the puniſhment for the ſatisfying of his law and juſtice. This they go about to prove
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:167891:54"/> by the example of Gods dealing with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> when they had ſinned againſt him, he forgave freely their fault and offence, nevertheleſs called them exactly to a reckoning about the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; was in perfect friendſhip with them again, yet would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate them an ace of the puniſhment which he had threatened to them, they muſt dye in the Wildernes and never enter into the land that flowed with milk and hony. The like they inſtance in <hi>David</hi> about his ſin in reference to <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> The Lord forgave the offence, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>thou ſhalt not ſurely dye,</hi> 2 Sam. 12, 13. Nevertheles in reference to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>David</hi> ſhall ſmoke for it. <hi>The child ſhall dye, the ſword ſhall never depart from his houſe,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that <hi>David</hi> ſhall rue it to his very dying day. Other Scriptures and reaſons they bring which would be over tedious to inſert.</p>
                        <p>Compare we now Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrine with theirs. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 7. he tells us, That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus being fully furniſhed for this work [of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] by his Fathers and his own will, firſt undertook and afterward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged mans debt by ſuffering what the Law did threaten, and the offender was unable to bear.</hi> And <hi>Theſ. 8. That the Father ſo fully accepted the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that by way of reward to Chriſt that gave it, he hath delivered all things into his hands, and given him all power in heaven and in earth, and made him Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> Yet <hi>Theſ.</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, addeth that, <hi>It was not the intent of either the Father or the Son, that by this ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the offenders ſhould be immediately delivered from the whole Curſe of the Law, and freed from the evill which they had brought upon themſelves, but ſome part muſt be executed upon ſoul and body,</hi> &amp;c. And this he goes about by his ten Arguments which we have examined, to prove of the beleevers themſelves, that they are liable to the puniſhment and Curſe of the Law, to bear it in part even to death it ſelf, and that though there be no unpardoned ſin for which the curſe as the curſe<note place="margin">Pag. 71. Arg. 8,</note> is inflicted upon them. Let any diſcreet man here judge if there be the leaſt haires breadth betwixt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Baxter</hi> and a Papiſt according to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> i. e. the worſt Papiſt. The rule of both about ſatisfaction is the ſame. Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us what we could not do and ſuffer for our ſelves ſay the Papiſts; Chriſt hath ſuffered for us what the Law did threaten, and we were unable to bear, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> implying that whatſoever we can bear muſt yet be inflicted upon us. For this ſatisfaction, the fault is forgiven, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> By means of this ſatisfaction there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no <hi>unpardoned Sin,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter [viz.</hi> upon beleevers.] Yet
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:167891:55"/> ſay both when the ſin is forgiven the puniſhment, curſe, and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law muſt be ſuffered. Here is noble mercy and forgivenes, to pardon a man his fault, and to pronounce with <hi>Pilate</hi> I finde no fault in him, and forthwith to whip and hang him for no fault. Such divine mercy and Juſtice do theſe white ſonnes of the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Father of Mercies, and to his dear Son the purchaſer and ſluce of all Mercies. Touching the doctrine it ſelf I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments. But as to theſe arguments of the Papiſts, I paſs them by, not having undertaken to anſwer them here any farther than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is their mouth to diſpute for them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Papiſts teach (according to the forementioned rule) that Chriſt hath in part alſo ſatisfied for the puniſhment of ſin, as well as wholly for the fault. And as far as Chriſt hath born and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo far we are freed from the puniſhment. But Chriſt hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied onely for the infinite &amp; eternall puniſhment, leaving us to bear the finite and temporary puniſhments and curſe of the Law, or to ſatisfie for it our ſelves. So that by their doctrine, Chriſt hath not at all by his merits freed us from the ſubſtance of the Curſe, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and vengeance of the Law, but onely from the boundles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and endles duration thereof. What ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to this? Chriſt (ſaith he) in reference to the puniſhment of ſin, <hi>hath ſuffered ſo much of what the Law did threaten, as we our ſelves were unable to bear. Theſ.</hi> 7. leaving to us to bear the greateſt Curſes of the Law, but not in their full rigor, <hi>and in their rigorous execution thereof.</hi> p. 69. Arg. 3. &amp; p. 71. Arg. 8. What is this rigor and rigorous execution of the puniſhment and curſe of the Law, but the execution of the ſame in its infinite meaſure and endles duration, which could not be (as he confeſſeth) born <hi>without the offenders everlaſting undooing. Theſ.</hi> 6. And thus he with the Papiſts makes the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath given to his Fathers Juſtice, effectuall to deliver us not from the ſubſtance of the Curſe and vengeance, but onely from the extent of its meaſure and duration. So that if I underſtand my mother lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the equipollency of terms and words therein, there is but the name, and a Cardinals hat that puts a difference between a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and a <hi>Baxter</hi> in this point, both ſpeak not onely the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem,</hi> but the <hi>Idem,</hi> the very ſelf ſame thing in matter &amp; ſubſtance, to the diminution, yea degrading of the merits of Chriſt, to make way to ſet up mans ſatisfactions parallell with if not ſupereminent and above Chriſts. With whom if I ſhould enter into a Conteſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument, and dared as they to make the Scripture a meer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:167891:55"/> 
                           <hi>Kickſhoſe,</hi> without ſubſtance and authority, under the Charm of diſtinctions to be formed, conformed, deformed unto and into any ſenſe at pleaſure, I could upon more probable grounds and with more plauſible reaſons argue that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for, and we by his ſatisfaction are delivered from the finite and temporary part of the Curſe and vengeance onely, but are left to bear for ever the infinite and eternall torment thereof in hell: than they bring for our deliverance onely from the temporary and not from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Becauſe (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) Chriſt ſuffered the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and finite pains onely for us, not the eternall, but left theſe (as it more probably ſeems) to be ſuffered by our ſelves for our ſelves. But as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not learn from Chriſt himſelf to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Majeſty &amp; power of the Word againſt Sophiſtry, ſo neither dare I learn to oppoſe his Sophiſtry againſt Chriſt and his Word.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Papiſts teach that thoſe puniſhments which come upon Chriſtians unavoydably by the threat of the Law, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the temporall evills that are incident to their ſouls and bodies in this life, as ſicknes, ſorrow, loſs of friends, credit or eſtates, poverty, tribulations, perſecutions, trouble of Conſcience, &amp;c. if they be ſuffered willingly and with patience, are ſatisfactions to God for ſin; but if unpatiently and unwillingly, they are Gods revenge upon us. So much the holy <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> doth even in expreſs words affirm and determine. What doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay in conformity or contradiction to this aſſertion? He tells us that all temporall evills do neceſſarily invade beleevers, and that by the force and Curſe of the Law, that when God ſanctifieth the ſame to them, he doth not thereby take away their naturall evill or their Curſe, but onely produceth by it as by an occaſion a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good. <hi>What reaſon can be given why God ſhould not do us all that good (viz.</hi> which the Orthodox Divines attribute to his ſanctified Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements) <hi>without our ſufferings, which now he doth by them,</hi> were there not <hi>ſin and wrath and law in them.</hi> Sure he could better us by eaſier means. <hi>They are managed by Chriſt to our advantage and good.</hi> Theſe are Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words, <hi>Pag. 69, 70, 72. Arg.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 7, 10. Let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle examine them. When we affirm that theſe ſufferings as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall beleevers, are not from the Law as a Curſe, but ſweet Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods love, by which he mortifieth the fleſh, increaſeth their ſelf-denyall, Conformeth them to Chriſt, as well in his ſufferings as in his graces and doings, exerciſeth and quickeneth all the gifts of his grace in them, Crucifieth the world to them and them to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:167891:56"/> world; and being in diſpute with Papiſts, mention many other precious ends and effects of his Chaſtiſements: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Comes in with his Tuſh at all this, <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Cannot God do us all this good (ſaith he) without our ſufferings, and better us by an eaſier means? What then? [Doubtles] there is ſin and wrath and law in theſe ſufferings. What can he mean by this, but that firſt there is our ſin as the merit of all theſe ſufferings, and ſecondly, that God in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them takes ſatisfaction from them and upon them for his law violated and his juſtice offended? Let any man that hath not divorced his reaſon from him through prejudice, pick out any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning of his words, or deny his words in this meaning to be heterodox and Popiſh. And when he ſaith that God doth by theſe ſufferings produce a greater good [to beleevers than their ſufferings bring evill upon them] <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. And that they are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to our advantage and good, what means he by this advantage and good? Not our purifying and bettering, &amp;c. as we hold, For this as we have ſeen, he ſhakes off as a ſingleſoled ſuppoſition, with a kinde of Apage. Nor any other good that his front hath yet taken boldnes to expreſs, for ſpeaking thereof ſo oft in generall, he would not have been ſo ſhie to ſpeciallize it for our edification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if there were any in it. It muſt be therefore ſuch a good and advantage, that though he would have us know, yet he will not ſpeak it out plainly, leaſt his tongue and teeth ſhould bewray him to be a profeſſed Papiſt, before ſuch time as he hath Phariſeelike, &amp;c. depraved others that are unwary, and made them worſe than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 15. And what ſhould that be, but that God takes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his juſtice by his judgments upon them, here, that they may not have, or may have the leſs to ſatisfie for, in hell or in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory? In this therefore as in the two former points I take him expreſſing himſelf an adopted ſonne of the ghoſtly Fathers of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Papiſts hold that there is a Purgatory, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to be a priſon as hot and full of the ſame materiall fire and flames as hell it ſelf: into which the ſouls of Chriſtians after this life, are caſt to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for all their veniall ſins that they have not made ſatisfaction for in this life by ſuffering or doing; and being once caſt into this priſon they cannot come forth out of the torment, untill they have paid the utmoſt farthing of their debt, <hi>i. e.</hi> untill they have ſuffered ſo much as may counterpoiſe to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grain, the ſinns whereof they dye unpardoned. This they prove
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:167891:56"/> by many undeniable Arguments, ſpecially by the teſtimony of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ſouls that have obteined a diſpenſation to come thence with their boſoms ſo full of fire as of fleſh and bones, to tell them ſo. Doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> joyn with them in this opinion alſo? Soft and fair, There is skill in daubing; firſt he will try how this Tractate will take; if according to his minde, probably we ſhall have a ſecond part, and therein he may tell us plainly his judgment in this and many other of his myſteries that here he leaves obſcure and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. In the interim it pleaſeth him not to deliver his minde herein in words at length, but in dark and uncertain figures. Yet joyn we together what he ſaith here and there in parcells, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may be made or at leaſt conjectured of it. Firſt then he telleth us that ſome part of the Curſe muſt be executed upon beleevers, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the whole man, the ſoul as well as the body. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 9. 2 That untill the day of Reſurrection and of Judgement, all the effects of ſin and law and wrath will not be removed from them. <hi>pag.</hi> 74.<note place="margin">Pag. 71: Arg. 8.</note> Therefore thirdly what he will not [doth not at leaſt] ſay of any of their former ſufferings, he ſaith of death, That there is no unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſin in it which ſhall procure further judgment, and ſo no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in it, though there be anger. A glorious privilege no doubt! ſuch as according to our uſuall proverb a man may find at Billingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for a box on the ear from the worſt of men that he meets with. When a man hath in revengefull fury perſecuted his hated nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with all the ſtrokes and ſtormes of wrath and miſchief, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many years perſecution, hath at laſt ſlaughtered him, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled his dead Corps into the mire and duſt; now at laſt he ceaſeth from hatred, &amp; is but angry with his poor reliques, forgives him all the reſt, when he can do no more to him, and forgivenes can do him no good. Such tender mercies of Cruelty (as the wiſe man terms them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12. 10.) doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here aſcribe unto God in his gracious dealings with beleevers for Chriſts ſake: <hi>viz.</hi> to perſecute them with all the ſtrokes of his wrath, and all the Curſes of the law all their life time, ſparing neither their body nor ſoul, and at laſt with great indignation to deſtroy them and trample their bodies into the earth, duſt, and rottennes, yea and their ſouls whither he liſt, and under what torment he liſt, and after this (ſo remarkeable is his love) he will hate them no more, but be angry with them ſtill. When they are dead and can offend no more, and God hath inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them all his judgments that he can inflict no more, now their ſins ſhall be ſo pardoned that they ſhall ſuffer no more, no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:167891:57"/> more than all which they already ſuffer. Who denies this to be the very quinteſſence of mercy and ſpirits of love when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſo defined it, and held it forth to us as the moſt Celeſtiall comfort that we ſhall finde in death? There is (ſaith he) no unpardoned ſin in the death of beleevers that ſhall procure further judgement. Where note 1 that he ſaith not ſimply and abſolutely that there is no unpardoned ſin upon the Saints now dead and buryed: but no ſin ſo unpardoned, that it ſhould bring further judgement than that which is already upon them. And 2 That when he denyeth that their ſin ſhall bring any further judgement upon them, he doth not deny but rather imply their ſins to be yet ſtill unpardoned as to the holding thoſe judgements upon them that are already inflicted. A comfort that the Devills and reprobates in hell ſhall not want after the very day of judgment in the midſt of their flames; That there is none of their ſinns ſo unpardoned as that it ſhould bring any further judgment upon them. But put we all together, 1 That the beleever muſt bear the Curſe, even the whole man, in body and ſoule alſo. 2 That he ſhall not be delivered from this curſe in ſoul and body untill the reſurrection. 3 That although death puts him into a freedom from further judgments, yet it doth not at all deliver him from thoſe that at death are inflicted upon ſoul and body. How ſhall we now make up the matter? If the whole man both ſoul and body muſt ſuffer and not be wholly freed untill the reſurrection, this is not fulfilled in the ſuffering of the body alone. If the ſoul alſo untill then muſt ſuffer, then is it not forthwith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its ſeperation from the body exalted to Heaven, for there, is no ſuffering, no affliction. Neither doth it ſuffer in hell, for Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> exempteth thence all that perſevere in the Faith (according to his definition of faith) untill death. Where and whence then ſhall it ſuffer but in and from the fire of Purgatory? And ſo there is no unpardoned ſin upon beleevers after death that can procure to them any further judgment beyond this. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meaneth not ſo, it is his fault to write with ſo much ambiguity, and ſo little plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and perſpicuity, as to toll us on to a ſtrong Conjecture that he meaneth ſo, and is in this as in the reſt apoſtatized to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 I might add alſo here that he ſeemes to joyn with the Papiſts in holding beleevers in an uncertainty of their ſalvation all their life long. It is conſiderable that neither in his Aphoriſm, nor in the whole explication therof, nor in all his arguments by which he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:167891:57"/> goeth about to prove beleevers under the Curſe, doth he once name any pardon of ſin, or freedom from further judgment, which they attain untill after death, and then when they have perſevered to the end, and dyed in Chriſt, now he mentions and affirms it. What doth <label type="milestone">

                        <p>We have found Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> diſpute here to be firſt againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 2 Antichriſtian and wholly Popiſh in ſeverall points. There are many allegations more wherewith it may be juſtly charged, <hi>viz.</hi> that,</p>

When they hear him to be ſo bloudy, to take delight in curſing, cruſhing, rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taring, and tormenting in ſoul and body, unto death and after death, his own ſonnes and daughters, and that under a profeſſion of grace and love to them, what difference can they conceive to be between ſuch a God, and the Devill? If there be ſuch bitternes in his love, who will deſire the leaſt draughts thereof? If his armes of embracing be ſuch Lions pawes, who will not ſhunn all union all drawing nigh to him? ſo doth he ſcandalize Gods love, &amp;c. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it terrible, (which is amiablenes and life it ſelf) that none might deſire him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 It is ſlanderous to the juſtice of God; 1 By accuſing it there to inflict the curſe, wrath, and judgements, where he imputeth no ſin. 2 By charging it to receive ful ſatisfaction for our debt from Chriſt our ſurety, and afterward when all is paid, to require ſatisfaction from us too. A piece of injuſtice ſo odious to the light of nature it ſelf, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would account him a prodigie of Nature, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villized man that ſhould ſo do: yet hath the face to charge the moſt righteous God, whoſe wayes are all equall, yea equity it ſelf, therewith.</p>

                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:167891:58"/>5 It is injurious to Chriſt and his Mediation. Charging him and it with inſufficiency. With the want (I mean) either of inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient merit to free us from the whole curſe and wrath of God, becauſe he could not do it, or want of ſufficient love to us that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all power given him in heaven and earth, yet will not do it. But in both theſe the Scripture teſtifieth Chriſt to be all-ſufficient, without the leaſt defect either of merit, or love to us, that in the infinitenes of his merit he hath purchaſed all, and by the infinitenes of his love he diſpenſeth this liberty in the fulnes of it to us, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ungratefully injurious to our bleſſed Saviour in denying it and arguing againſt it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 It tends to the advancing of mans vain-glory and boaſting, in being at leaſt in part a ſelf-ſaviour, that his ſatisfactions have wrought with the Lord Chriſts in the procurement of his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation. This by the ſequele of this work appears to be the main thing to which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> driveth. For yeelding himſelf up to be the Diſciple of men, to ſee and judge onely by the light of mans reaſon, he ſeems to me to be ſo left of God deſtitute of his Spirit, that he can ſee no farther than a meer naturall man in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things; and ſo following the letter and ſcarce the letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of the word, he can think of no other way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but that which the very inſtinct of nature ſuggeſteth, namely a mans own willing, running, and procurements. To this end he laies a foundation here of humane ſatisfaction by ſufferings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving well that if mans ſuffering of the curſe of the Law be once granted to be effectuall by way of ſatisfaction to purge the ſoul from ſin, then much more the righteouſnes of workes done in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and conformity to the Law, by the help of the Spirit, will and muſt be granted to be more powerfull to the ſame end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeks he thus to depreſs the grace of God and merits of Chriſt, that upon the ruines thereof he might erect a Temple dedicated to mans righteouſnes.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 It ſubverteth all the joy and conſolation of Chriſtians, which the Holy Ghoſt requireth of them in their ſufferings from Chriſt or for Chriſts ſake. How can we according to the precept of Chriſt, <hi>Rejeyce and be exceeding glad, when we ſuffer,</hi> Matth. 5. 12. And with <hi>Paul, Glory in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5. 3. and <hi>Rejoyce in our ſufferings,</hi> Col. 1. 24. And after the rule of <hi>James, Account it all joy when we fall into many temptations,</hi> Jam. 1. 2. If theſe be the curſe of the Law, the effects of Gods wrath and heavie diſpleaſure?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:167891:58"/> and glory in his fathers anger, and in the curſes and ſtrokes of his fathers wrath which he hath juſtly deſerved? It is enough to add deſpair and death to the ſorrow of the Saints in their afflictions, to poſſeſſe their Conſciences with an apprehenſion that all comes from their fathers wrath, and hath the curſe upon it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 It holds poor Chriſtians upon a rack of torment, and under the ſpirit of intolerable bondage all their life-time.

                        <p>So much by way of anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> reſolving of his third queſtion. There remain yet three queſtions more; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bax. 4.</hi> Whether it be not a wrong to the Redeemer, that the people whom he hath ranſomed, be not immediately delivered [from the Curſe]?</p>
                           <p>5. Whether it be any wrong to the redeemed themſelves?</p>
                           <p>6. How long will it be till all the Curſe be taken off beleevers, and Redemption have attained its full effect?</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>The two former of theſe queſtions, are ſawcy, arrogant, and proud. In their propoſall, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> acts the part of Satan in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning and accuſing Gods Juſtice. In his anſwer to them he takes upon himſelf to act the part of an Angel, to be an Apologiſt to plead for the defence of Gods juſtice. 2 Gods juſtice is not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be injurious to any, ſo that God needs not an Apologiſt to plead his cauſe; if he needed, his wiſdome would not make choice of his accuſer to be his Advocate. 3 Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> if he would have dealt ingenuouſly, ſhould have put the queſtions whether himſelf be not injurious; 1 To God and his Chriſt; 2 To the redeemed by denying their deliverance from and affirming their proſtrate bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Curſe, and not to have queſtioned whether his ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Gods juſtice hath made God faulty. And then he ſhould have received an anſwer to his reſolving of the queſtions. But as he puts the queſtions I reject his reſolving of them as unworthy of an anſwer. Onely by the way I ſay, that what he ſpeaks in anſwer to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:167891:59"/> his own queſtions is all meerly ſophiſticall and fallacious. The three firſt reaſons that he brings to prove that Chriſt is not wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the not delivering of his ranſomed ones, being things in queſtion not proved by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> therefore in arguing from them he doth (as it is uſuall with him) beg the principle. The fourth reaſon is not <hi>ad idem,</hi> but ſo farr from the queſtion as <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Barwick,</hi> that there is no hope they will ever meet together. The queſtion ſpeaking of beleevers, The reaſon, of Chriſts dealing with the world to make them beleevers. And the ſame is evident in what he ſaith to the fifth queſtion alſo. The ſixth queſtion he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth;</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bax.</hi> The laſt enemy to be overcome is death, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 26.</hi> This ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will be perfectly overcome at the Reſurrection. Then alſo ſhall we be perfectly acquitt from the charge of the Law, and accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Satan: Therefore not till the day of Reſurrection and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will all the effects of ſin and law and wrath be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>If in the concluſion he mean the effects of ſin and law and wrath ſhall not be removed from the world untill the reſurrection; he ſpeaketh truth, but <hi>nihil ad rem,</hi> far from the queſtion which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely of beleevers. If he mean of them that the Curſe ſhall not be removed. I have anſwered it before, and the Scriptures here brought to prove it, and will not here <hi>Actum agere.</hi>

                           <hi>Baxter</hi> had ended, but he had not finiſhed his diſpute about the Curſe upon beleevers. He did but Parthian or ram-like, go backward and decline a little, to return with the greater force. Or as an Actor upon the ſtage, withdraw and make his <hi>exit,</hi> to put on a new dreſs, in which to appear again forthwith to act a ſecond part. So doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> decline the diſpute in one Aphoriſm
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:167891:60"/> and its explication, (which I alſo ſhall paſs by without excepting againſt it) and then he returns to proſecute the ſame diſpute afreſh; yet in another dreſs of words, that it might ſeem to be a reſolving or determining of another queſtion. That was, whether beleevers remain under the Curſe of the Law? This, whether they remain under the Law as it threateneth and curſeth? And between theſe two queſtions who ſeeth not ſo vaſt a difference, as is between an arrow in the quiver, and an arrow out of the quiver? within and without the quiver, it is the ſame arrow ſtill. Yet let us attend to him ſtating the queſtion (which anon we ſhall examine.) The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of it is thus.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> That the Morall Law (not in its directive uſe but) as it is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, is ſtill in force to threaten and bring the Curſe upon beleevers, in caſe they do in any thing tranſgreſs the Law.</q>
                        <p>This he undertakes to make good, pronouncing it inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to aſſert the contrary. <hi>Theſ. 11. p. 78. &amp; explic. p. 79. &amp; explic. of Theſ. 12. p.</hi> 82.</p>
                        <p>Here before we meddle any further with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſpeaketh to this point. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> ſaith th'Apoſtle to believers.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> I conceive there is no one Chriſtian upon earth that hath his head unbiaſſed with ſophiſticall fallacies and falſhoods, but takes the words in the ſame ſimple and clear ſenſe wherein the Holy Ghoſt delivers them, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are no more under the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, when we have once attained by faith to be under the Covenant of Grace. But a very thunder-bolt againſt Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his Aſſertion is that, <hi>Gal. 5. 3, 4. I teſtifie to every one that is circumciſed, that he is debtor to do the whole Law. Chriſt is become of none effect to you whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> From theſe words muſt needs be deduced theſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That to be under the Law, and to be under Grace, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and do exclude either the other, ſo that it is impoſſible for the ſame perſon at the ſame time to be under both together. If but circumciſed, if at all under the Law, ye have (ſaith the Apoſtle) made Chriſt of none effect to you, ye are fallen from grace, and conſequently if at all in Chriſt, yee are not in the leaſt part under the Law, but free from the domination and Curſe thereof.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That whoſoever yieldeth himſelf to be under the Law as a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:167891:60"/> Covenant of Works, in the leaſt part, hath his juſtification or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation depending upon his perfect or unperfect keeping of the whole Law, ſo ſaith th'Apoſtle, if but circumciſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ye are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to keep the whole Law: How debtors, <hi>viz.</hi> If ever ye will be juſtified and ſaved to keep it perfectly, if ye fail but once, to be damned for ever.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That whoſoever affirmeth (whether he be a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or a <hi>Baxter</hi>) believers to be under the Law as a Covenant of Works, the ſame by neceſſary conſequence denyeth all actuall efficacy of Chriſts death, that ever any ſoul was or ſhalbe ſaved by his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and affirmeth all the Saints that have been, are, or ſhalbe, to be damned for ever. For if at all under the Law, then not at all under grace or in Chriſt; but they muſt ſtand or fall according as they do or not do the whole Law, which none doth, <hi>ergo,</hi> all muſt periſh. The ſame alſo may be gathered from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. but I have touched upon it before.</p>
                        <p>A noble Aphoriſt ye will acknowledg, declaring a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bring the Saints under the Curſe and damnation, then there is force in his Diſputes to prove them to be under it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Scriptures might ſuffice to ſatisfie every judgment, that believers are not under the Law. Yet I ſhall mention ſome few more to ſhew the copiouſnes of the word in this point, that there might be no doubting in this point, <hi>Rom</hi> 7. 1-6, the Holy Ghoſt doth make out this truth as clear as the light. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath dominion over a man</hi> [onely] <hi>during life, as the husband hath power over his wife.</hi> Let either the husband or wife dye, the law or power which the husband had over the wife dyeth alſo. If the wife dye he hath no power over the ſoul or aſhes of his dead wife, to exact under any penalty, obedience from them. If the wife be ſurvivor, ſhe is no more bound to the dead aſhes of her husband, to fear either command or wrath thence, but is wholly at liberty. So alſo ſtands the relation between the Law and believers. The Law in the height of its authority had power to inflict death but once upon man; this death have believers ſuffered in Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>are dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, have done their Law, and ſuffered all that the Law had to inflict upon ſinners, in the body,</hi> or humane nature of Chriſt ſuffering for them; ſo that they are dead to the Law, ſo far without the liſts of further puniſhment or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Law, as the Felon or Murtherer that is condemned, hanged, dead and buried, is free from further puniſhment, by the Law of the Land.</p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:167891:61"/>
                        <p>Yea the Law alſo is dead to them, having ſpent it's ſting and ſtrength, and life alſo on the naturall body of Chriſt, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſabled for ever to re-aſſume the ſame againſt the myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or any member thereof: So that they are [fully] <hi>delivered from the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All this doth th'Apoſtle ſpeak out at the full in that place, and no leſſe in <hi>Gal. 3. 24, 25. The Law was our School-maſter unto or untill Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</hi> This alſo he illuſtrateth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, &amp;c. by a ſimilitude, likening the Church before Chriſts coming to <hi>an Heir in his Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by his fathers will put under Tutors and Governors, ſo that though he be Lord of all, yet differs nothing from a ſervant, but is under his Tutors ferule and rod alſo,</hi> to be conſtrained with fear, when love becomes ineffectuall to move him to his duty: ſuch was the condition of the Church while in its minority and feeblenes of ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Sun of righteouſnes not being yet riſen fully to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them with the underſtanding of their liberty and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives. During this time though they were Lords of all, yet becauſe of the weaknes of their knowledg they were kept Servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like under hard Maſters, under the Commands and threats of the Law: but reſembling the Church under the Goſpel, to the ſame heir in his maturity of age, now entred into the poſſeſſion of his heritage, and become rather Lord of his Tutors and Governours, then any way ſubject or ſervile to their authority, gently and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly accepting their wholſom Counſels, but diſdaining ſo to ſubject to their authority, as to be brought under the rod of their power any more.</p>
                        <p>So alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 18, 23. ſpeaking of them that had been <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the liberty of the Goſpel, believing in Chriſt, walking in the Spirit, and bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> concludeth of them, that <hi>they are not under the Law, that againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. cals the Law (as a Covenant of works) <hi>that which was done away,</hi> as he doth the Goſpel (as a Covenant of Grace) <hi>that which remaineth.</hi> Yea that the caſe might be ſo plain, that no Jeſuiticall diſtinctions might pervert it, the Holy Ghoſt at once concludeth, both negatively that believers are not under the terrours of the Law at all; and affirmatively that they are wholly and onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſweet diſpenſation of grace, <hi>Heb. 12. 18-24. Ye are not come to the Mount,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>burning with fire, nor unto blacknes, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt, nor to the words and Covenants which could not be

                        <p>So alſo in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians.</hi> There are <hi>two Covenants</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>the one from Mount Sinai</hi> (where the Law was given) <hi>which gendereth to Bondage,</hi> [the other from] <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem which is above and is free, the mother of us all,</hi> and concludes at laſt of all believers, negatively, <hi>that they are not the children of the Bond-woman, i. e.</hi> under the Covenant of works, and <hi>affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence is that bold triumphant challenge of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that hath dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who ſitteth at the right hand of God and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having laid down theſe two poſitions as truths undeniable, that Chriſt hath effectually ſatisfied, and as a perfect Mediator ſits at the right hand of God, making interceſſion for believers: And that God thereupon juſtifieth them: He now boldly challengeth earth and hell: who ſhall charge them? who ſhall condemn them? Yea his interrogations bear the force of ſtrong negations, as if he had ſaid, None can effectually charge much leſs condemn them, yea none dares to attempt it, no not one, not ſin, nor Satan the Lords Enemies, much leſs the Law which is juſt and conformed to the will of God.</p>
                        <p>Collect we together now but ſome ſhort notions of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what the Holy Ghoſt concludeth in them and by them, that believers are not under the Law, that it is an apoſtacy from Chriſt, from grace, to put themſelves in the leaſt part under the Law as a Covenant of works; that they are dead to the Law, that the Law is dead to them, that they are delivered from the Law, are no more under it, were ſervants to it, but are now free from it, there is no Law againſt them, that it is done away from having any dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over them, that they are departed from the Lawes terrours, and come to the Goſpels celeſtial previledges; are not under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, but under the Covenant of Grace, have the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of their preſent condition not from <hi>Sinai</hi> but from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> are ſons not of the bond-woman but of the

                           </gap> be poſſible for the wiſedom of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, which is infinite, to give his teſtimony more fully, cleerly or plainly to this aſſertion, that believers are not under the curſing power of the Law, or under the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works? whether this truth hath not from theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture a ſufficient fortification raiſed about it againſt all Jeſuits and Devils. Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with horn and hoof, tooth and nail aſſaults it, partly by ſecret minings, and partly by open batteries to ſubvert it. I ſhall hold out his ſlights, in his owne words.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B. Theſ. 11.</hi> Not that Chriſt doth abſolutely null or repeal the old Covenant hereby <hi>[viz. by conſtituting a New Covenant</hi> Theſ. 10.] But he ſuperaddeth this as the onely poſſible way of life. The former ſtill continueth to command, prohibite, promiſe and threaten: ſo that the ſins even of the Juſtified, are ſtill brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that Law, and are threatened and curſed thereby.</q>
                        <p>This is his firſt plea, his diſpute in generall, againſt the before proved Aſſertion.</p>
                        <p>The Aphoriſm conſiſteth of meer obſcurities, ambiguities, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and mentall reſervations in words and phraſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Aphoriſt hides himſelf that he may ſmite and not be ſmitten; ſpeaking in words of a double and doubtfull ſenſe, that he may beguile the unwary in the ſenſe wherein he would be underſtood, that he may deceive; and yet in caſe that by them which are wiſe and wary he be called <hi>ad partes,</hi> to anſwer for his fallacious ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he might fly for ſhelter to the other ſenſe that he might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a deceiver.</p>
                        <p>And firſt the word <hi>nulling,</hi> yea the phraſe <hi>abſolutely nulling,</hi> is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, equivocall, and fallacious. A thing, a law, a covenant may be ſaid to be nulled, <hi>i. e.</hi> made void or none, either as to its eſſence and being, or as to its power and operation: yea to be <hi>abſolutely nulled</hi> in ſome operations, though abſolutely in force in other. Null as to ſuch ends or perſons, though in its perfect va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity to other. But when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith abſolutely null, he would be taken in another ſenſe then he dares to avouch in the ſenſe that the words do moſt litterally and gramatically import,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:167891:62"/> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> the whole and abſolute nulling of it not onely to ſome, but to all operations, ends, and perſons: yea not onely to its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but to its being alſo. For ſo much that diſtinguiſhing word (abſolutely) inſinuateth, <hi>viz.</hi> in contra-diſtinction to <hi>ſecundum quid.</hi> that it is nulled, not as to this or that purpoſe, in this or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reſpect, but abſolutely, ſimply, wholly, from having any more operation or being. And this equivocation of his ſerves him to three ends.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 To leave a ſecret accuſation and odium among the people upon the Orthodox Divines againſt whom his diſpute bendeth, that they deny both the power and being of the Law of God, and hold that it is become uſeleſs and abrogated, ſo that the people of God muſt be no more acquainted with it. And this is a tacit ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for who among them ever taught ſuch things?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To lay open to himſelf a wide field for a luxuriating and extravagant diſputation, to affirm or deny, confirm or confute any thing about the preſent ſtate of the Law, knowing that what is incompetent to what he aſſerteth in one ſenſe, will be enough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent in another, and he doubts not while he is thus circling and roving, ſome pur-blind ones will be taken in his ſnare, if none els yet at leaſt ſuch as are made to be taken, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That if his words come to a ſtrict examination, how little of ſimplicity and truth, how much of doublenes and falſhood is couched in them, he may not want a place of retreat: his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſooth was but ſo and ſo, and there is a fault in them that miſtake him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The ſame might I ſay of the word <hi>repeal</hi> which he uſeth. But becauſe he repeats it again in the Explication of this Aphoriſm, affirming that there are godly and learned men that hold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of the firſt Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall there ſpeak what els might be here not unfitly ſpoken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 No leſs ambiguous is it what he will have us to underſtand by the Old Covenant, which he affirms not to be nulled, but to have the New Covenant ſuper-added to it: at leaſt to what ſenſe thereof he will ſtand. Whether he meaneth,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The Law of nature not ſounded in the ear but written in the heart of man at his Creation, <hi>Doe and live, Sin and dye?</hi> Or</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That Covenant expreſſed in the word, about a poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of not eating of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill. <hi>Eat and dye,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Abſtein and live?</hi> Or</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:167891:63"/>3 The Covenant of the Law written in ſtones upon <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai?</hi> If the firſt, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf ſometimes declares his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether there were ſuch a Law, with a clear impreſſion of its penalty, ever created and imprinted in mans ſoul? And there are not wanting ſome among the moſt profound and Claſſicall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which hold that whatſoever notions of naturall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and holines, of God, of good and evill, of truth and falſhood, there are in naturall men without the word; the ſame not to be ingraven into them by nature, or remainders of any Law written in mans heart at his firſt Creation: but of Gods immediate infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a generall and common operation of the Spirit in time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to ſome in a greater to ſome in a leſſer meaſure, to ſome ſcarce at all, as his infinite wiſedom ſhall ſee it to make moſt for his glory. And from theſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems elſwhere not to diſſent. And how then can that be nulled and repealed, or what new ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-addition can there be made to that whith was never in being? much leſs can a Covenant ſtand firm, which was never exiſtent.</p>
                        <p>If the ſecond, then contrary to his Aſſertion, the Old Covenant in reſpect of our perſonall Obligation to it, and of the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our life and death upon it according to our perſonall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience to it, is nulled; there being now no acceſſible Paradiſe, nor tree of knowledg of good and evill, about which our obedience may be exerciſed, or diſobedience mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
                        <p>If the third, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaketh point-blank in contrariety to the Apoſtle, in ſaying that the Covenant of Grace was added to the Law or Covenant of works. For the Apoſtle giveth the priority to the Promiſe or Covenant of Grace, and affirmeth expreſly that the Law or Covenant of works was many hundred years after, added to it: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 19. So that we know not where to meet with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to underſtand, much leſs to anſwer him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 He hath a mentall reſervation alſo, when he affirmeth that the <hi>Covenant of Grace was ſuper-added as the onely poſſible way of life.</hi> Who knows whether he pronounceth it the onely poſſible way to life, as it hath fulture and ſupportance from the Law and Covenant of Works to which it is ſuper-added, and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the Mount do ſave a poor ſinner, and what the Law could not do of it ſelf, being weak through the fleſh, [that could not fulfill it] <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. Now by the ſuper-added help of Grace, it doth perform? Or as it is operative in it ſelf and by it ſelf, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:167891:63"/> by its own ſoveraign power without any help from the works of the Law. Why doth not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeak out? <hi>Veritas non quaerit angulos.</hi> Truth loveth to ſhew its face in the cleer light, not hiding it ſelf in the clouds. I do no wrong to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>Baxter</hi> in preſſing upon him for his meaning herein; every man may ſee in the ſequell of his Tractate, that grace and faith have with him, very little power to juſtifie or ſave, but what they borrow and fetch home in a Cardinals Hat or Monks Cowl from good works.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And he leaves us in the dark and doubtfull, what he means by the word <hi>hereby,</hi> when he ſaith Chriſt doth not null the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>hereby,</hi> it is a relative word and muſt have its meaning from that which is antecedent in the tenth Aphoriſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of a new Law, and <hi>tendering of a new Covenant.</hi> The old Covenant is not nulled <hi>hereby</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Doth he mean by the tendering of the New Covenant? Or the offer of Grace? This makes nothing to the end he drives at. None conceiving that the offer or tendering of Grace to a ſinner, doth forth with free him from the Curſe of the Law, untill he accepts the tender. Or doth he mean that the effectualizing of the Covenant of Grace to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or the taking of him effectually into the Covenant of Grace, doth not make void the Law to him as a Covenant of works? This is indeed like himſelf, and agreeable to his purpoſe. He is not conſiſtent with himſelf nor with the moſt ſubtle and ſophiſticall of the Papiſts whom he loves as dearly as himſelf, if he do not ſo mean. Nevertheles becauſe he is willing here to paſs under a viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, I will not trouble my ſelf to unmask him. Himſelf will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly enough diſcover himſelf to us, when the humour takes him. At preſent let him be ſullen.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 The ſame might I ſay of that which followeth. The former, <hi>i. e. The Covenant of works or the Law, ſtill continueth to command, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite, promiſe, and threaten.</hi> A wide dominion and large authority, but who the ſubjects &amp; ſervants are over whom it is exerciſed, he leaves (as all the reſt) in an ambiguity, is not diſpoſed to tell us, except the next words do it. So that the ſins even of the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are ſtill breaches of that Law, and <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7 But here alſo he determineth to paſſe away in the dark, tells us onely what power the Law hath againſt the ſins, not againſt the perſons of the juſtified, that it threatens and curſeth their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, but whether onely upon the perſon of Chriſt ſatisfying
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:167891:64"/> for them; or els in their own perſons alſo, after Chriſt hath ſo ſatisfied, is a ſecret that at this time and in this place, we muſt not know from him; though if he had not let it out before, he would have been in pangs of travell with it untill he were delivered of it.</p>
                        <p>Thus have we found M. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this Aphoriſm fighting againſt the fore-mentioned Concluſion and the Scriptures that confirmed it, with his ſword in the ſcabbard. How terrible the skirmiſh was they that felt either the point or edge of his weapon can tell you. Suppoſe he ſhould now unſheath it, who could ſtand before his drawn ſword? This he is about to do, by his</p>

                                 <hi>Mr. B.</hi> I acknowledge that this aſſertion is diſputable and difficult, and many places of Scripture are uſually produced which ſeem to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it. I know alſo that it is the judgement of learned and godly men, that the Law as it is a Covenant of works, is quite null and repealed in regard of the ſins of believers. Yea many do believe that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works is repealed to all the the world, and onely the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace in force.</p>
                              <p>Againſt both theſe I maintain this aſſertion, by the Arguments which you find under the following Poſition 13. And I hope not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that I extoll free grace as much, and preach the Law as little, in a forbidden ſenſe; as though I held the contrary opinion.</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Firſt he acknowledgeth his Aſſertion to be diſputable and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. We have found it not onely to be ſo, but to be ſo of his own making, by means of his clothing it with the darknes of ſuch and ſo many ambiguities, equivocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Againſt it he ſaith there is a two-fold authority uſually produced, the one Divine, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee humane. The one he deſpiſeth and blowes of as contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the other he falſifieth (I am confident) that he may have ſomewhat to ſay in anſwer to it.</p>
                           <p>1 There is Divine authority or many Scriptures produced, which ſeem to contradict his Aſſertion. And here take we notice in how baſe eſteem he hath the Holy Scriptures; of thoſe many Scriptures he vouchſafeth not to anſwer one, no nor to cite one: why? but that he thinks, when the Scriptures, and his own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions do contradict either the other, the authority of his own judgment not only to parallel but alſo to over-weigh the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures. What Papiſt, what Enthuſiaſt hath or can have the Scriptures in leſs eſteem then this Aphoriſt ſhews himſelf
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:167891:64"/> here and elſwhere to have? What Scriptures are brought againſt him, he diſdaineth them an anſwer, yea a glance of his eye to ſee them, or tongue to read them to us. But if he finds any Scripture whoſe point with much bowing and wreſting he thinks he may turn about againſt us that have no more wit but to think their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority venerable and requiring our ſubmiſſion thereunto: of theſe he makes uſe, to befool yet more ſuch fools as regard them. If I fail in my cenſure, the Lord forgive to me the miſtake of my judgment, and to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> his giving occaſion, yea cauſe of ſuch a miſtaking.</p>
                           <p>And as the authority of Scriptures is pufft from him with leſs then a piff or piſh, ſo do we find humane authority (in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) falſified by him. I know (ſaith he) that learned and godly men are of this judgment that the Law as a Covenant of works is quite null and repealed in regard of the ſins of beleevers. I do not doubt but by theſe learned and godly he means ſome Proteſtant Divines, whom ſomtimes he will flatter, ſmooth, and almoſt ſpit in their mouths, to allure them to run after him. Now if he do not falſify their aſſertions, let him name but one of them that ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Law to be ſo repealed. I may poſſibly acknowledg him to be, in the main, learned and godly, but I believe I ſhall never account him to have been conſiderate in laying down ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. For it directly contradicts the doctrine of our Saviour, <hi>Think not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am come to deſtroy the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am not come to deſtroy but fulfill. Verily, verily, Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs, but not one jot or tittle ſhall not paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5. 17, 18. Or to whom ſhould it be repealed? not to unbeleevers; for it is conſented in both ſides that they are under the Law, under the Curſe. Nor to beleevers, for the Law hath purſued their ſins unto death in the body of Chriſt, and by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath inflicted upon him for them, upon them in him, the <hi>tantundem</hi> if not the <hi>idem</hi> which it ever threatned againſt ſinners. And how is the Law repealed in any of its power, that doth or hath executed all its power upon all that have been tranſgreſſors? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> very well knoweth what doctrine is taught in the Reformed Churches, but will needs falſify it, as he doth alſo the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                           <p>We affirm that the Law is ſtill in force and ſhall be til the worlds end. We preach not a repeal of any of its power or righteouſneſs which it had from God at any time. Neither on the other ſide, do
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:167891:65"/> we attribute to it a power or unrighteouſnes which God never gave it. We grant it a power to take full vengeance upon every ſinner for every ſin committed during life. But we deny that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be raiſed to a ſecond life after death (as was Chriſt) having born the whole wrath due to the ſins of the former life, that ſuch a one comes under the power of the Law again; the Law hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more dominion over him. But ſo ſtands the caſe with belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: They have ſuffered in Chriſt, done their Law in Chriſt, are dead in Chriſt, and in him they have ſatisfied the Juſtice of the Law for the ſins of their whole life. If now they are alſo riſen with Chriſt, and are dignified with a new life, the life of grace, ſo that though they live, it is not ſo much they that live, as that Chriſt liveth in them, and the life which they live in the fleſh is by the faith of the Son of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. In this new life which they have by their union unto Chriſt, now triumphant, the Law can no more reach them, then Chriſt himſelf triumphant. So the Law is nulled to them, but never repealed, nulled becauſe it hath inflicted upon them its whole pena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ty, and after it hath ſo done, it hath no more power over the very reprobates, much leſſe over the Saints. So that the Law being null or of no force to believers, hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no diminution to its power, holding it ſtill firm and entire as ever; no more then the Law of the Land is weakened for that when it hath inflicted death upon the Felon or Traytor, it hath no further power to queſtion him. As, before they had exiſtence in <hi>Adam,</hi> their not exiſting yet in him, and under the Law by being in <hi>Adam,</hi> argued no weaknes in the Law: So when they have don their Law for the ſins committed while under the Law, and that by their new union unto and exiſtence in Chriſt, they ceaſe to be under the Law, that the Law hath no power over them, argues no wound or weakneſſe or detriment that the Law hath ſuſtained; any more then it doth, becauſe it is null in power to the Angels in Heaven, over whom it had never power: or null unto Chriſt now in Heaven, over whom it had once power.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> acknowledgeth that the penalty of the LAW is due to none but the tranſgreſſors of the Law, to the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and withall affirms <hi>Theſ.</hi> 16. p. 96. and <hi>Explication</hi> page 98, 99. That Satisfaction for diſobedience is our Righteouſnes, makes a man ſo perfectly righteous (as to the Law and further penalty thereof) as if he had never diſobeyed. Yet we find him here fighting not onely againſt Heaven and Earth, but againſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:167891:65"/> himſelf alſo, to deny the nullity of the Law to them that have ſatisfied by CHRIST, for their diſobedience to the Law; making it one and the ſame thing with the repealing of the Law. This word repealing being here foiſted in by himſelf, partly to make way for his ſophiſticall, and bombaſticall diſtinctions which are no leſs deer to him then his life, therefore in the Explication of the next Theſis, comes in great oſtentation, no leſs trappled with them, then a Cart-horſe with his painted Collar, bells and fethers, partly to give occaſion of his riding in ſtate upon <hi>Grotius</hi> his ſhoulders, to ſhew what new, ſubtle, and fine-ſpun learning, he hath drawn from ſo noble and Apoſtaticall a Doctor, no leſs fit to the Argument he hath in hand, than the ſhoo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>As for the other pretended opinion, that the Covenant of works is repealed to all the world, and the Covenant of Grace alone in force: Thoſe that hold it (moſt probably) are ſome Eutopians that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alone, and no other either man or Angel beſides him have had acquaintance with, or the happines to know their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might have done well to have taken a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond voyage into the land of Eutopia, either to have joyned with them or diſputed againſt them upon their own happy turf, and not to have troubled our unhappy Coaſts with this Controverſie: it hath the unhappines doubtles to be peſtered with ſo many opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts as any Nation in the world, but among all hath not ſuch bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears or phrenticks, that I know, who maintein ſuch an aſſertion.

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Bax.</hi> And ſo I reſolve the queſtion thus.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 The law of works is not abrogate or repealed, but diſpenſed with, or relaxed. A diſpenſation is (as <hi>Grotius</hi> defineth it) an act of a ſuperiour whereby the obligation of a law in force is taken away, as to certain perſons and things.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 This diſpenſation therefore is not totall or abſolute, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective. For 1 Though it diſpenſe with the rigorous execution, yet not with every degree of execution. 2 Though the law be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with as it conteineth the proper ſubjects of the penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> the parties offending, and alſo the circumſtances of duration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in regard of the meer puniſhment, abſtracted from perſon and circumſtances, it is not diſpenſed with. For to Chriſt it was not diſpenſed with. His ſatisfaction was by paying the full value.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 Though by this diſpenſation our freedom may be as full as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a repeal, yet the alteration is not made in the Law, but in our eſtate and relation to the Law.</p>
                              <p n="4">4 So farr is the Law diſpenſed with to all, as to ſuſpend the rigorous execution for a time, and a liberation or diſcharge condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall procured and granted them. But an abſolute diſcharge is granted to none in this life. For even when we do perform the condition, yet ſtill the diſcharge remains conditionall, till we have quite finiſhed our performance. For it is not one inſtantaneous act of beleeving, which ſhall quite diſcharge us, but a continued faith. No longer are we diſcharged than we are beleevers. And where the condition is not performed, the law is ſtill in force, and ſhall be executed upon the offender himſelf.</p>
                              <p>I ſpeak nothing in all this of the directive uſe of the morall Law to beleevers, but how farr the Law is yet in force even as it is a Covenant of works; becauſe an utter repeal of it in this ſenſe is ſo commonly, but inconſiderately aſſerted. That it is no further over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, no not to beleevers, then is here explained. I now come to prove.</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Here we ſee the off-ſpring of the precedent mountainous and ſwelling diſtinctions. <hi>Exit ridiculus mus.</hi> In the three firſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:167891:67"/> a meer tattle about the repealing and abrogating, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and relaxing of the Law; and of its diſpenſation in a totality and abſolutenes, or in a reſpectivenes to perſons, circumſtances and degrees of execution, &amp;c. which is as proper to the thing that he drives at, as ſwines fleſh and a peacock ſtrangled, with all his glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering feathers, to the ſatisfying of a Jewes hungry appetite. Surely either Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> had forgotten, or thought we had forgotten that he had before vented this Myſticall learning of his own and <hi>Grotius</hi> his brain; or doubted that it was not finely enough ſet out there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might have the full praiſe of ſo curious and ſpider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threeded a ſpeculation, brings it in here again, in ſomewhat a new and more ſpecious a dreſs. Let him reſt contented, we acknowledge it all very trim. If he beleeve us not, let him ſet it as a philactery upon his garment. It will tend ſo much to the ſtrengthening of it, as of the cauſe he hath in hand. For the queſtion is not whether the Law be repealed or but diſpenſed with, But whether it be in force to beleevers as a Covenant of works, with which the three firſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions meddle not. The word [abrogating] ſome orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (I confeſs) do uſe, but not in a ſenſe equipollent with the word [repeal,] meaning thereby onely a nullity of the lawes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation over beleevers. The alteration not being in the Law (as we acknowledge with Mr. <hi>Br.</hi>) but in our eſtate and relation to it. The law reigneth over all that are under it. But the Saints are not<note place="margin">Inſt. lib. 3. cap. 19. ſect. 2.</note> under the Law, ſaith the Apoſtle, But as (<hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it.</p>
                           <p>But his fullnes and plainnes in his fourth Concluſion maketh ſome recompence for all his Amphibologies, all his dark &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full locutions in that which went before. Here we acknowledge his ingenuity, He ſo ſpeaks as that an Engliſh man may underſtand him. Here he tells us what he meant before of nulling, repealing, &amp;c. of the Law to beleevers, that it is not ſo nulled, abrogated, repealed, relaxed or diſpenſed with, but that all their life time they are ſtill under the Law as a Covenant of works. And why could not this be ſpoken, without ſo great a preparative of ſophiſticall equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſtinctions? It pleaſed him ſurely to act the Alderman that deckt himſelf with all his robes and rich furniture, to go into his ſtable and cutt off his horſes tayl. But it ſhall ſatisfie us that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſuſpenſion, he at laſt diſcovers to us his meaning. Let us examine it, and firſt we ſhall finde ſet forth in two poſitions; two ſo ſoul-raviſhing priviledges, purchaſed by the Lord Chriſt for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:167891:68"/> the Elect Saints, that whoſoever of them will reſt ſatisfied with them, may gird himſelf faſt, and depart without them. 1 That they have ſo large a diſcharge from the rigor of the Law for a while, as any of the worſt reprobates. 2 That they have no more diſcharge from the Lawes curſe than the worſt of reprobates. Muſt we not account him a Saint that hath a faſtidious ſtomack or ſore mouth that cannot reliſh theſe dainties. The former Concluſion he reacheth to us in theſe words. <hi>So farr is the Law diſpenſed with to all, as to ſuſpend the rigorous execution of it for a time, and a liberation and diſcharge conditionall, procured and granted them. Jam ſumus ergo pares.</hi> In this the ſons of God are in as good a caſe as the reprobates, and ſomwhat before the Devills. The latter Concluſion in theſe words; <hi>But an abſolute diſcharge is granted to no man in this life. Jam ſumus ergo pares.</hi> Yet have we as large cauſe of exulting and joy in the Holy Ghoſt as the reprobates, that (as farr as we can diſcern) we are no neerer to hell than the children of hell, whoſe inheritance is in hell forever.</p>
                           <p>To prove the latter aſſertion, that none are, that beleevers are not abſolutely diſcharged from the law as a Covenant of works, in this life, he borroweth matter from Pelagians, Papiſts, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arminians, and the whole rabble of profeſſed enemies to the grace of God in Chriſt, manifeſteth (<hi>Scotus</hi> like) <hi>ignotum per ignoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> carries us into a dungeon of darknes, to diſcern Colors which we could not judge of in the light, to his minde; brings ſeven other Devills, many other hereſies worſe than the firſt, at leaſt ſo bad as the firſt, to ſtrengthen the firſt. <hi>Clavum clavo</hi> [not] <hi>extorquet,</hi> [but] <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet &amp; figit,</hi> beats in other wedges not to looſe the firſt, but to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten all. Having gotten in the paw of the beaſt, beats and beetles in many of his hornes after to wedge faſt all.</p>
                           <p>The Popiſh errors which he brings as an addition to confirm that beleevers are during life, under the law, are theſe. 1 That they which are in Chriſt have not their ſinns fully pardoned, neither are themſelves wholly juſtified in this world. 2ly, That whoſoever ſhall be juſtified in the world to come, muſt procure it by his own willing, running &amp; perſevering in this world. 3 That they which are in Chriſt may fall away and be damned. 4 That no man while he lives can be certain of his ſalvation. 5 To this he addeth one worſe than any Popiſh or Socinian hereſie as proper to himſelf and from himſelf alone, <hi>viz.</hi> That all beleevers (notwithſtanding Chriſts ſatisfaction for them, notwithſtanding their perſevering faith in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:167891:68"/> him, yet) muſt be at laſt damned forever. Some of theſe errors are in expreſs words aſſerted, the reſt by neceſſary Conſequence imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this ſhort diſpute of Mr. <hi>B:</hi> The firſt he expreſly affirmeth. Even when we do perform the condition, yet ſtill the diſcharge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Here he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this point</hi> Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs the Papiſts.</hi>
                              </note> conditionall (ſaith he) till we have quite finiſhed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, <hi>i. e.</hi> till we have gaſped out the laſt breath. So that in this life there is no diſcharge, but a conditionall promiſe that poſſibly we may in the world to come be diſcharged. what is this diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Juſtifying and abſolving us? from what but from the ſinn which we have committed, and from the vengeance which the law threateneth? ſuch a juſtification he denyeth to be attainable in this life. And this argument he thus urgeth; Whoſoever is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified, is ſtill under the law as a Covenant of works. But the very Saints are not in this world ſo Juſtified <hi>ergo</hi> they are under the Law, &amp;c. The ſecond, that Juſtification in the world to come muſt be procured by mans own willing, &amp;c. He delivereth plainly enough in that he ſaith, that we muſt perform, yea continue performing the conditions untill we go out of this world, and then we may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obtein to be juſtified in the world to come. What are the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which we procure the diſcharge? Mr. <hi>B:</hi> tells us afterward (as we ſhall finde) Faith and good works. Theſe muſt we obſerve and continue obſerving to the end to procure juſtification after this life ended. And ſo it is by our own ſtrong and laſting endeavours, that after the world is ended our ſins may be poſſibly forgiven, and we ſaved. Here if we grant unto him, that we are Gods hirelings thus to work in his vineyard the whole day, the whole term of our life; and that Juſtification is the wages of our work to be paid in the evening, <hi>i. e.</hi> at the end of the world, then it will follow indeed (what he deduceth hence) that untill the world be ended we are ſtill under the Curſe of the Law. 3 That they that are in Chriſt may fall away and be damned if they continue in their Apoſtacy, or may after their many apoſtacies, oft renew again their union with Chriſt, and ſo at laſt be juſtified, he ſpeaks out fully in telling us, <hi>It is not one inſtantaneous act of beleeving, but a continued faith that ſhall quite diſcharge us; that no longer are we diſcharged than we are beleevers, and when we ceaſe to beleeve, the Law is ſtill in force, and condemneth.</hi> Either he reaſoneth from an unpoſſible ſuppoſition, or a poſſible and uſuall Caſe incident to beleevers. If from an impoſſibility, it makes not at all for his purpoſe. If it were poſſible for him to fall from grace, then ſhould beleevers be under the Law again. But it is not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:167891:69"/> poſſible, &amp;c. <hi>ergo</hi> they ſhall never be reduced under the law again. But he argueth as from a poſſible and uſuall caſe, and then if we grant him, that the Saints may fall away, it will follow that they are not abſolutely freed from the curſe of the law in this life. But in granting this, we grant our ſelves to be Popiſh, and may ſhake hands with Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> The fourth, that no man can in this life be certain of ſalvation, depends on the former. For if we cannot be certain of our perſeverance, we cannot be certain of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines: and by neceſſary conſequence it muſt be concluded alſo that we are not diſcharged from the bondage of the Law. But we cannot grant the premiſſes from which ſuch inferences are drawn, unleſs we will grant away our ſelves alſo in deſpair to perdition. And therefore we deny to Mr. <hi>B:</hi> all his argumentation here, as having nothing of Chriſt, but all of Antichriſt in it.</p>
                           <p>I mean not to proſecute in this place a diſpute againſt Mr. <hi>B:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe four pernicious errors which he holds in common with other Papiſts; himſelf will elſwhere miniſter to me an occaſion of ſpeaking more fully to them, where he doth not onely touch upon, but alſo profeſſedly handle the moſt (if not all) of them. Here I ſhall onely (to preſerve the ſimple from his guile) manifeſt upon what fallacious grounds he pitcheth theſe his aſſertions. They are principally theſe two.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 That Faith as an infuſed gift of grace, and a part of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe doth juſtifie, when it is not onely (as the Papiſts ſay) <hi>Fides informis,</hi> but alſo <hi>Formata,</hi> perfected both in its duration of time, and in all its Concomitants the other habits, vertues, and gifts of grace, ſuch as are love, mercy, goodneſs, temperance, &amp;c. and in the fruits and acts of all theſe which are good works. For ſo ſhall we finde him in the ſequele of this tractate teaching.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 That Faith and all thoſe its Concomitants with their fruits and effects depend upon our freewill, to gain and retein, refuſe and loſe them at the pleaſure and luſt of our corrupt freewill. Theſe points being granted all thoſe foure errors will follow as neceſſary deductions thence. But the orthodox Churches hold and the Oracles of the Goſpel teach otherwiſe. 1 That our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on floweth from our union to Chriſt, that All in <hi>Adam</hi> are under the Law, under the Curſe, unbleſſed, unjuſtified, unpardoned. But that all which are in Chriſt are juſtified, pardoned, &amp;c. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. &amp;c. <hi>All things are doung to me that I may winn Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſnes, which is of the law,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:167891:69"/> but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Here was the Apoſtles righteouſnes and Juſtification to winn Chriſt and be found in him. And this union unto Chriſt is made up principally by the Spirit, by which Chriſt apprehendeth and uniteth us to himſelf. No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is our Juſtification attributed to faith than as it is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which we apprehend Chriſt to our ſelves as we are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of Chriſt to himſelf, and bring home into our boſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> the benefit of this our union to him, together with the ſenſe and joy of our Juſtification by him. This I ſhall have occaſion to illuſtrate and prove more fully before I part with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and becauſe he will call me to it in another place, here I ſhall ſay no more of it. 2 That our Faith both in its exiſtence and perſeverance, dependeth not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fickle ſweek of our own freewill, but upon the ſupport of Gods power and unchangeable love, and upon the vertue of Chriſts mediation and faithfullnes of the Mediator; though our freewill be mutable, yet the gifts &amp; calling of God are without repentance, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Change. <hi>Rom. 11. 29. He that hath begun a good work in you, will performe it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 6. Though our faith be weak, yet we are preſerved by the power of God through Faith and ſalvation. Chriſt hath by his ſacrifice purchaſed to us, not onely ſalvation but faith alſo, both in its being and perſevering to apprehend him and it to our perſevering Conſolation; <hi>They ſhall never periſh</hi> ſaith he) <hi>neither ſhall any man,</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>If now the word of God ſtand, and the judgement of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that is grounded upon the immutable word of the eternall God; then thoſe bug-bear aſſertions, the (brats of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtinctions) which he brings as arguments to prove the ſlaviſh bondage of beleevers under the Law, will appear vaporous and ſo vaniſh. For if our Juſtification proceed not from the old age or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of faith &amp; its Concomitants, but from our union to Chrſt, and no otherwiſe from faith than as it inſtrumentally cloſeth us with Chriſt (which no inſtantaneous Faith, that lives and dyes at an inſtant, but a truly living faith can do) then it will appear to be a falſhood, that None is juſtified in this life. Nay all that by a living faith are united to Chriſt, are fully juſtified in this life. And as many as are unjuſtified here, ſhall not be either juſtified or ſaved hereafter.</p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:167891:70"/>
                           <p>Again, if our Juſtification ſpring from our union with Chriſt, then not at all from our own willing, running, and perſevering. And ſo his two firſt Arguments fall into ſhivers.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 If no true and juſtifying faith be inſtantaneous, and the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of faith in the beleever, and of a beleever in the faith, depend not upon mans mutable will, but upon the all ſufficiency of Chriſts merits, and the truth and omnipotency of the moſt high God: then his two latter aſſertions, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Apoſtacy from Chriſt, and the other of the uncertainty of ſalvation, fall into ſhivers alſo. For what more fixed and certain than what by the will of God, is bottomed and ſuſteined with the rock Chriſt, and the truth and power of the eternall God? None then of his popiſh arguments here brought, do give the leaſt fulture to his aſſertion, that <hi>The very belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are under the Law as a Covenant of Works.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The fift Poſition, that all Believers (according to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrine) muſt needs be damned, ariſeth from the Aſſertion which by the four mentioned Propoſitions, as by ſo many Arguments, he goeth about to prove: <hi>viz.</hi> That untill death they are under the Law as a Covenant of works.

In all this (ſaith he) <hi>i. e.</hi> in this whole diſpute, I ſpeak nothing of the directive uſe of the Law, [<hi>viz.</hi> as it is a rule and Counſeller to a Chriſtian in all morall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:167891:70"/> righteouſnes] <q>but how far the Law is yet in force as a Covenant of works, becauſe an utter repeal of it in this ſenſe is ſo commonly but inconſiderately aſſerted.</q> [Let him name but one conſiderable man that ever affirmed the Law repealed, that it may appear it is not a ſlander which he caſts upon the Anti-Papiſts.] But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <q>That it is no further overthrown, no not to believers, then is here explained, I now come to prove.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And we ſhall come after him to ſee what he proveth, and how far he proveth. And that it may appear to all what ſincerity is in the man, two things are to be kept diligently in mind.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 What he is to prove.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 What he is not to meddle with in proving, if he will ſhew himſelf honeſt, and not a meer Impoſter.</p>
                           <p>We utterly deny any repeal or abrogating of the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works to them that are under the Law, or have not don their Law, yea any repeal of the Law at all, as I have made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Therefore if Mr. B. go about to prove either that the Law is not repealed, or that unbeleevers or ſuch as have not done their Law by ſatisfying for the breaches thereof, are ſtill under the Law; This is fallacious dealing, a proving of that which never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queſtion, for all acknowledg it without his proving. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he is to prove is that none, no not believers are abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Law, but are under it as a Covenant of works to the utmoſt moment of their life. This he promiſeth throughout his whole diſpute to prove, let us attend how he doth it in this 13 Poſition, under which he promiſeth to do it.</p>

                              <hi>B. IF</hi> this were not ſo, but that Chriſt had abrogated the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then it would follow.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <pb n="84" facs="tcp:167891:71"/>1 That no ſin but that of <hi>Adam,</hi> or finall unbelief is ſo much as threatned with death, or that death is explicitely (i. e. by any Law) due to it or deſerved by it. For what the Law in force doth not threaten, that is not explicitely deſerved or due by the Law.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 It would follow that Chriſt dyed not to prevent or remove the wrath and curſe ſo deſerved, or due to us, for any but <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, nor to pardon our ſins at all: but onely to prevent our deſert of wrath and curſe, and conſequently to prevent our need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 It would follow that againſt eternall wrath, at the day of judgement, we muſt not plead the pardon of any ſin but the firſt; but our own non deſert of that wrath: becauſe of the repeal of that Law before the ſin was committed. All which conſequences ſeem to me unſufferable, which cannot be avoided if the Law be repealed.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Unto theſe three Arguments he addeth four more in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Poſition, which thus follow.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> We may plead our non deſerving of death, for our diſcharge at judgment.</p>
                           <p>5 And further, then Chriſt in ſuffering did not bear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to any ſin but <hi>Adams</hi> firſt, for that which was not threatned to us, was not executed on him. This is a clear but an intolerable conſequence.</p>
                           <p>6 Scripture plainly teacheth that all men (even the Elect) are under the Law till they believe, and enter into the Covenant of the Goſpel. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Jo. 3. 18. He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> ver. 36. And we are ſaid to believe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Mark 1. 4. Luke 24. 47. Acts 10. 43. &amp; 3. 19.</hi> which ſhew that ſin is not before remitted; and conſequently the Law not repealed but ſuſpended and left to the diſpoſe of the redeemer. Els how could the redeemed be the children of wrath? <hi>Eph. 2. 3.</hi> The circumciſed are debtors to the whole Law, <hi>Gal. 5. 3, 4.</hi> And Chriſt is become of no effect to them: but they that are led by the Spirit are not under the Law, and againſt ſuch there is no Law, <hi>Gal. 5. 18, 23.</hi> The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin (and ſo far under the Law no doubt) that the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, might be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:167891:71"/> given to them that beleeve, <hi>Gal. 3. 22.</hi> We are under the Law when Chriſt doth redeem us, <hi>Gal. 4. 5.</hi> See alſo <hi>Ja. 2. 9, 10. 1 Tim. 18. 1 Cor. 15. 56. Gal. 3. 19, 20, 21.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our deliverance is conditionally from the curſe of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> if we we will obey the Goſpel. And this deliverance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law, is it which is ſo oft mentioned as a privilege of believers, and an effect of the blood of Chriſt. Which deliverance from the curſe is yet more full, when we perform the conditions of our freedom. And then we are ſaid to be dead to the Law, <hi>Rom. 7. 4.</hi> and the obligation to puniſhment dead, as to us, <hi>ver. 6.</hi> but not the Law void or dead of it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>7 Laſtly all the Scriptures and Arguments, <hi>p. 60 61.</hi> which prove that afflictions are puniſhments, do prove alſo that the Law is not repealed. For no man can ſuffer for breaking a repealed Law, nor by the threats of a repealed Law; yet I know that this Covenant of works continueth not to the ſame ends and uſes as before; nor is it ſo to be preached or uſed. We muſt neither take that Covenant as a way to life, as if now we muſt get our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by fulfilling its conditions, nor muſt we look on its Curſe, as lying on us remedileſs.</p>

                        <p>Alas for the conſcience of this man!

                        <p n="1">1 That the Law as a Covenant of works is not become null and void to believers, <hi>p.</hi> 79. that they are not diſcharged in this life from the curſe of the Law, <hi>p.</hi> 82. But that</p>
                        <p n="2">2 They are under the Law as a Covenant of works ſtill, after that they are in Chriſt and partakers of of his Redemption. Why had he not by and by proved it, but that he might <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>-like, firſt buſie his Reader with Sophiſticall diſtinctions and diſputes, untill he had forgotten the ſtate of the Queſtion, and then prove what he would, not what he ſhould to his forgetfull Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der For ſo there is not the leaſt gry or jota in all his Arguments here that doth ſo much as glance upon the things that he was to prove, but a labouring to confirm things which no one of thoſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:167891:72"/> whom he makes his adverſaries, doth or did ever Queſtion, much leſs deny. So that all theſe his Arguments, are meer <hi>impoſtures,</hi> not (as he tearms them) Reaſons to confirm the Doctrines which he pretends to prove.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, his five firſt Arguments (or rather thoſe three in his Theſis, which in the Explication he ſub-divides into five) and the ſeventh alſo in the Explication tends only to prove that God hath not, did not revoke, repeal and extinguiſh the Law that it ſhould have no more a being, or remain a Law to the ſons of men; aſſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, and a promiſe of redemption by Chriſt was made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. who ever taught or thought ſo? or what is this to prove that the Saints (after they have ſuffered and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in and by Chriſt the whole penalty of the Law, for all their tranſgreſſions of the Law) are not delivered from it as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the other Argument which he puts in the ſixth place goes about to prove that unbelievers are under the Law. And this is as potent a reaſon to prove believers to be under the Law; as if I ſhould thus argue, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a Jeſuite, becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Maldonat</hi> were Jeſuite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This might ſuffice as a full Anſwer to his ſeven Arguments and to manifeſt his ſin and ſhame in uſing them. But I ſhall add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Explication to make that which I have ſaid plain to the weakeſt. Not imitating Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who under a pretence of Explication, doth in moſt places totally darken what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cleer and plain.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then, I grant to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that if Chriſt had from the beginning of ſins entrance into the world, repealed and (in the proper and full ſenſe of the word) abrogated the Law, thoſe five conſequences, which he mentioneth in his 5 firſt Arguments would follow,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That no ſin but that of <hi>Adam,</hi> and finall unbelief is ſo much as threatened with death, the one being forbidden by the Law while it was in force, the other by the Goſpel, that is ſtill unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably in force, Nay not any thing elſe in reference to the old Covenant but that of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be a ſin, becauſe ſin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, and where there is no Law, there can be no tranſgreſſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:167891:72"/>2 That Chriſt by his ſatisfaction for us, prevented not the wrath deſerved [<hi>viz.</hi> otherwiſe then by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin] but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of wrath.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Neither doth he properly pardon any ſuch ſin, for where no Law is, there is no ſin, where no ſin, there is nothing to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 And then might we plead innocency, or our non deſerving of death (except before excepted) for our diſcharge at judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And Chriſt in ſuffering did not bear the puniſhment of any other ſins of mankinde beſides the fore-mentioned. Thus we grant Mr. <hi>B.</hi> five of his Arguments without any detriment to our Cauſ or advantage to his. Believers are as fully freed from the Law as if he had ſlept while he thus diſputed. For all theſe his Arguments lean upon a falſe ſuppoſition. If the Law be ſo repealed and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated (as is before ſuppoſed) then and not els will theſe curſed Conſequences take place. But the law is not ſo repealed <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of theſe will follow. For we hold that Believers are therefore delivered from the law as a Covenant of works, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the law was almoſt from the very beginning repealed or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated from being any longer a Covenant of works, but becauſe the law as a Covenant of works hath executed upon them in Chriſt all its penalty for all their ſins, and hath therefore now no more power to queſtion them: as hath been more copiouſly declared before.</p>
                        <p>The ſame I ſay alſo to the ſeventh Argument as it pointeth to the not repealing of the law, whatſoever els is in it, hath been in anſwer to the place cited, ſufficiently ſpoken to.</p>
                        <p>His ſixth Argument about which he laboureth more then about all the reſt, though (as I ſaid a little before) it makes nothing to his preſent and explicit purpoſe, proving onely unbelievers to be under the law; (for this is nothing to believers) yet it makes way to an implicit or ſecret end which he hath, and determineth to proſecute with much ardency in the following parts of this Treatiſe. There are two ſorts of unbelievers, the one under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, the other under a finall unbelief, the elect and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here driveth with all his force to prove both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, becauſe he conceiveth that if he prove the elect before they beleeve in Chriſt, are under the law, and ſo granted to be, it may be proved much the more eaſily and plainly, that they are ſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:167891:73"/> alſo after they become believers. For many of the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are for the one are for the other, and which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one are againſt the other alſo: So that it is hard to bring reaſons for the affirming or denying of either, without giving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the like affirming or denying of both.</p>
                        <p>I purpoſe not here to anticipate but to ſuſpend the diſpute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Queſtion untill Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhall ſhew his face openly as a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger; here he doth but as it were peep behind the Curtain, in compariſon of what he ſaith afterwards with full expreſſions of himſelf. Yet that I may not be forced then to retreat hither again to what he doth here deliver, but anſwer every thing in its owne place; I ſhall at preſent examine thoſe Scriptures which he here produceth, whether and how far they prove elect unbelievers to be under the law as a Covenant of works.</p>

To come to Chriſt is to believe truly in him, ſuch ſhall never be loſt, never fall away, or make ſhipwrack of their Faith. But who are they whom God giveth to Chriſt that they may beleeve in him? <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will ſay they were in a peculiar manner to be Gods people, at leaſt by election, and therefore given to Chriſt that by faith in him they might be ſaved, <hi>Jo: 17. 6. To you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of God, but unto them that are without all theſe things are done in Parables; that ſeeing they may ſee and not perceive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11, 12. Why was it given to the one part to know the myſtery life and ſpirit of the Goſpel, to the other onely the outſide and letter thereof? They were within, theſe without the lines of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                           <hi>They went out from us but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would without doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not of us,</hi> 1 Joh: 2. 19.

This is, that Chriſt by offering himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, and preſenting the Sacrifice of himſelf unto God in the moſt Holy place, <hi>i. e.</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at his Mercy-ſeat, hath thereby effectually purchaſed everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redemption, and remiſſion of ſins, and hath received a full ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and acquittance from the father for all his elect by name. So that in Chriſt they are juſtified from all ſin, and freed from the Law as a Covenant of works even while they are unbelievers, have this freedom (I mean) in the hand of Chriſt though not in their own apprehenſion and poſſeſſion. Though as to themſelves and their own judgments, and as to the apprehenſion of men, they are under the Law, under wrath, yet in Chriſt they have done their Law, their iniquities paſt preſent and to come are blotted out,

They were his people before, therefore muſt they be gathered to him by Faith. <hi>I have other ſheep which are not of this fold: them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voyce,</hi> &amp;c. Jo: 10. 16. he means the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were infidels yet, nevertheleſs his ſheep that muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward hear his voice, becauſe they were his ſheep, how were theſe termed Chriſts people, Chriſts ſheep, while yet in Paganiſm, idolatry and unbeleef, but becauſe they were his redeemed and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified ones? <hi>Ye beleeve not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep,</hi> Jo: 10. 26. What is that, but becauſe they were not of the number of them for whoſe ſins he had effectually ſatisfied Gods juſtice.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſins may be conſidered alſo as it is brought into their own apprehenſion and Conſcience, that were juſtified by Chriſt, and in Chriſt before. And in this ſenſe it is ofteneſt taken in Scriptures, yea alway when we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith. This is done when Chriſt by the manifeſtation and miniſtry of the Goſpel maketh known in all ages to them for whoſe ſins he hath ſatisfied, the Myſtery of Grace by him, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their hearts with all gladnes by Faith to embrace him and it thorow him, unto Juſtification. Then are they juſtified in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and remiſſion of ſins ſealed up by the ſpirit to their own Conſciences, and ſo have the Kingdom of God within them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Peace, Righteouſnes, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Before this Chriſt had life for them, now they are ſaid to have it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Jo: 20. 31. 1 Jo:</hi> 5. 12. Untill now was their winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo that all their life was in Chriſt as the Vine or Root, now is their ſpring, ſo that the life ſheweth it ſelf in them as the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es bloſſoming with peace and joy unto all obedience. Before life was purchaſed and ſeizure thereof taken for them by Chriſt: Now they are paſſed from death to life, 1 <hi>Jo: 3. 14. i. e.</hi> are put into the actuall poſſeſſion of it. Before though they were Lords of all (as the Apoſtle in a caſe little different from this ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2.) yet differed nothing from Servants, being (in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) under the threats and condemnation of the Law, and ſo ſtill in ſlaviſh, fears and terrors. But now they ſee their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and take poſſeſſion of it, with boldneſs to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and to enter into the Holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, and through the veil of his fleſh, with full aſſurance of hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hebrewes 10. 19, 20.</p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:167891:75"/>
                        <p>Theſe things ſo premiſſed, we ſhall the better ſee whether the Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here produceth, do by their own force, or elſe by his miſ-interpretation of them ſeem to prove that the Elect while unbeleevers, are under the Law as a Covenant of works. Firſt that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. is a threat of the Goſpel Covenant againſt the Contemners of it and of Chriſt the preacher thereof, and not of the Law Covenant. And it is brandiſhed againſt reprobats and not againſt elect unbeleevers. Chriſt had now preached his Goſpel a while in <hi>Galilee;</hi> the elect beleeved, and of them ſaith Chriſt <hi>they are not condemned.</hi> The reprobates would not beleeve; of them he ſaith, <hi>they are condemned already:</hi> and the reaſon is rendred, not becauſe they have broken the morall Law, but <hi>becauſe they have not beleeved in the Name of the onely begotten Son of God. This is the condemnation that</hi> [Chriſt the] <hi>light is come into the world, and men preferred their own darknes before him,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame alſo is the meaning of the 36 ver. which he citeth. Neither of theſe pointing in their threat to the elect but the reprobates among unbeleevers. Neither threatening for Contumacy againſt the Law but the Goſpel. Therefore nothing here proveth the elect before they beleeve to be under the Law, as a Covenant of works.</p>
                        <p>Again thoſe Scriptures which he ſaith bid us to beleeve for the remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, &amp;c. do only prove that faith in Chriſt doth juſtifie the elect in the third conſideration of Juſtification or remiſſion of ſinns before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> as it evidenceth and brings home into their apprehenſion and Conſcience that their ſinns are remitted. For ſo run the words, in that 10 of <hi>Act. v.</hi> 47. that <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins;</hi> not denying that Chriſt had received it for them before, but affirming only that now they ſhould receive it from Chriſt. Beſides, this promiſe is held forth there promiſcuouſly to all both elect and reprobate, and it is but an offer not the gift of pardon, to diſtinguiſh betwixt them for whom Chriſt had and thoſe for whom he had not effectually ſatisfied and received abſolution from the Father, by the ones beleeving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by faith from the hand of Chriſt, the pardon, and the others refuſall and manifeſting thereby their abode under death and the Law ſtill. The ſurety had paid the penalty of the obligation, taken up the bonds, and acquittance or diſcharge of the debt. Thenceforth the Creditor had no more plea againſt either principall or ſurety. Nevertheles the principall knew it not, therefore playeth leaſt in ſight, is in continual fear of arreſts, thinks every buſh hath a Sergeant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:167891:75"/> or Bayliff under it; but at length the ſurety gives and delivers into his hand both the acquittance, &amp; the obligation Cancelled. Now is his firſt receiving of a diſcharge, now he firſt finds himſelf free from his Creditors obligation, now hath he the firſt comfort of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but he was diſcharged before, though he knew it not; ſo is it with the elect, &amp;c. Therefore Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> inference hence is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</p>
                        <p>He addeth the Teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. <hi>That the redeemed were by nature the Children of wrath:</hi> who denyeth it? But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the queſtion. It is not here enquired whether the redeemed drew not the ſeeds of ſin and death by naturall propagation from their parents, as much as others: But whether by the ſatisfaction which Chriſt made for them, according to the Covenant of grace, they were not redeemed from that wrath before they yet beleeved. It is true what <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid of himſelf and his brethren, to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, We were all as dead men before my Lord the King,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Sam. 19. 28. becauſe they were the progeny of <hi>Saul</hi> that fought againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Nevertheles by means of the Covenant that intervened between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, Mephiboſheth</hi> had right to all the favour that King <hi>David</hi> could expreſs.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe teſtimonies cited by way of <hi>Theſis</hi> and <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> out of <hi>Gal. 5. ver. 3, 4. &amp; ver.</hi> 18, 23. they make wholly againſt him, nothing for him. The 3 &amp; 4 verſes, ſpeak nothing to the queſtion in hand, but utterly deſtroy that to which in this whole diſpute he driveth, nothing to the queſtion in hand. <hi>The circumciſed are bound</hi> or debtors <hi>to the whole Law, and Chriſt is become of none effect to them.</hi> He was to have proved that beleevers, were before they beleeved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. This Text ſpeaketh not of the elect before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, but of profeſſed beleevers returning to Circumciſion and the Law, to fetch thence help unto their juſtification after that they ſeemingly at leaſt beleeved in Chriſt: ſo here is nothing that makes for him, becauſe nothing to the preſent queſtion. But much againſt him in reference to the grand thing which he laboureth for, to bring beleevers under the Law as a Covenant of works. Whoſoever doth ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in the leaſt mite, that contents not himſelf with Chriſt alone, takes in but ſo poor a peice of the Law as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to help with Chriſt to Juſtification, the ſame perſon hereby forfeiteth all his claim to Grace and Chriſt, and muſt gain heaven by his perfect fullfilling of the Law, or muſt be damned in hell for ever. Into this ſtate Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtriveth to bring himſelf and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:167891:76"/> I ſhall not wiſh them joy in it, becauſe I uſe not to wiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities. Touching the verſes which he puts in oppoſition to theſe, <hi>ver. 18, 23. But if ye be led by the Spirit ye are not under the Law, againſt ſuch there is no law.</hi> If he mean ſimply and ſincerely what the Apoſtle here meaneth by being <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> viz. the ſeeking of righteouſnes by Chriſt alone, as the ſame Apoſtle more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf, <hi>Gal. 3. 3. Phil.</hi> 3. 3. Then by granting that ſuch are not under the Law, there is no law againſt them; he deſtroyeth and recanteth all that he hath before ſpoken to prove beleevers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. But if by being led by the Spirit, his aim be to bring in works to juſtification under the name of the fruits of the Spirit, we ſhall here forbear to anſwer him, becauſe it is beſides the preſent queſtion, leaving it to its fit place where he openly explaineth himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And no leſs abhorrent from the queſtion is his next proof, <hi>Gal. 3. 22. The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt may be given to them that beleeve.</hi> What is this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in hand? we deny not the promiſe of, or the promiſed Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and remiſſion of ſinns, by faith in Jeſus Chriſt to be given to them that beleeve, into their hands and poſſeſſion when they beleeve, by affirming that Chriſt hath taken poſſeſſion thereof for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beleeve, that he may let it down into their hearts when they beleeve. <hi>He aſcended up on high, and led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.</hi> Eph. 4. 8. The Apoſtle fetcheth his authority from the word in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>He received gifts for men,</hi> viz. to give them in his time. But the Apoſtle contents himſelf with the ſcope of the word, not binding himſelf to the bare letter and ſound thereof. So Chriſt at his aſcenſion received for us the gifts of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and remiſſion, and all other benefits of his paſſion; They were then laid up for us in his Cuſtody, ſo that we had them in him before our actuall exiſtence upon earth. But he gives them to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſenſible poſſeſſion, when we come to be, to live and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                        <p>That which he citeth from <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 5. is altogether beſides the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion alſo. Himſelf acknowledgeth that it proveth us onely to be under the Law when Chriſt redeemed us, or undertook to pay our ranſom. Not that we were under the Law after he had redeemed us by paying our ranſom, before we yet beleeved. The words are theſe in the 4 &amp; 5 verſes; <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> The ſcope of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:167891:76"/> here, is one and the ſame with that to which he drives, <hi>Gal. 2. 15, 16. We who are Jewes by nature,</hi> [a holy ſeed, within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and have all the privileges of the Law] <hi>and not ſinners of the Gentiles</hi> [that are without the Covenant and the Law] <hi>knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt; even we have beleeved that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the law, for by the works of the law no fleſh is juſtified.</hi> Why then do we draw the poor Gentiles to ſeek any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to their juſtification, by the obſervation of the Law, by which our ſelves who were moſt privileged with it could not be juſtified but by Chriſt onely without the law? So here, Even they that had the law and were not a little zealous for and active in the righteouſneſs of the law, had need of a redeemer, were juſtified and ſaved not at all by the lawes righteouſneſs, but onely by Chriſts redeeming of them: What madnes is it then in you O fooliſh <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that are not of the holy ſtock of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſinners of the Gentiles to ſeek any help to your juſtification by the works of the law, which could not juſtifie the very <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were born and brought up in it: and not to repoſe your ſelves upon Chriſt alone? If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will pretend any other meaning of the Text beſides, he ſhall therein wound and not ſtrengthen his Cauſe. For he ſpeaks of the ſame perſons here, to be under the law onely in the hand of a Mediator, not under the Curſe of the law, but under ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof, that even before they actually beleeved in Chriſt, the very perſon of Chriſt, are affirmed <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to be Lords of all, all the inheritance which is by Chriſt; <hi>ergo</hi> not under the wrath of God before they embraced the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>As for the other Scriptures which he annexeth yet further to prove, that the very elect before and untill they beleeve, are under the Law in the ſenſe ſo oft manifeſted; let him once ſhew how he will argue, and what he will conclude, and upon what grounds, from them; we ſhall be ready to anſwer him. In the interim I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I ſee not any thing in them more prevalent to his purpoſe, than a nights lodging in a bed of ſnow and ice, to cure the Cough.</p>
                        <p>Yet from all theſe wreſted Scriptures he Concludes at laſt that the deliverance which beleevers have by Chriſt from the Curſe of the Law, is a conditionall deliverance, <hi>viz.</hi> if they will obey the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they beleeve, if they will beleeve, not onely while they live, but alſo when they are dead and buried.

This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a full and perfect deliverance. But what doth he mean in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>when we perform</hi> &amp;c. <hi>either when we are performing the conditions,</hi> That were a contradiction to himſelf in what he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 74. that <hi>we are not perfectly freed till the day of reſurrection and judgement.</hi> And ſo alſo it will be hard for another ſave Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> to make ſenſe of the words. That the deliverance of beleevers is yet more full when they perform the Conditions, are performing the conditions of their freedom; <hi>i. e.</hi> more full <hi>when they beleeve than when they do beleeve.</hi> For if we ſhould grant to Mr. <hi>Br,</hi> Faith to be a condition, and not rather a mean or inſtrument of our juſtification, yet would we grant him no other condition thereof. Or doth he mean, it is full when they have performed the Conditions? it ſeems then that ſome of the Conditions are left to be performed in the next world, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then he tells us we can have no ſuch perfect freedom.</p>
                        <p>This is the free Grace of God which Mr. <hi>Br</hi> boaſteth himſelf ſo much to extoll, <hi>p.</hi> 79. let him that delights in it, be his diſciple. That which he ſpeaks in the upſhott for the mitigation of his harſh doctrine aforegoing; (that he knoweth this Covenant of works continueth not to the ſame ends and uſes as before, &amp;c.) is but a trick of the Jeſuits, to give ſugar after the poyſon which was before gone down to deſtroy. Neither can he make out how beleevers are under the law of nature as a Covenant of works, and yet not bound to ſeek life according to the tenor and condition of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                        <p>If any marvell that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould ſo waſte his ſpirits in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both divine and humane learning to prove the Saints to be ſtill under the Curſe, under the law as a Covenant of works, he will

He would not out of doubt have ſo much inſiſted on it, had he not looked to a further end in it. If the beleevers are ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of works, as to the Curſe, wrath, and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more are they under a Covenant of works as unto life and Juſtification. If the former be once granted, he accounts the game wonn as to the latter. Therefore doth he ſo much ſtirr in the former, that he may with the more facility and leſs contradiction, bring in afterwards the latter, Juſtification by works, which is his very buſines in Compiling this book.</p>

For here again he concludes that the very Tenor of the New Covenant is that notwithſtanding Chriſts ſufficient ſatisfaction made to the law, they muſt remain unjuſtified, unpardoned, under ſin, under vengeance to the end, and then poſſibly after many hundreds and it may be thouſands of yeers wherein their bodies have laid under rottennes, and their ſouls under all hell-torments which the law can inflict, they ſhall be juſtified. And this (very probably) ſhall be about that time when <hi>Origens</hi> reprobates and devills ſhall ariſe from hell and fly away thence all at once and together to heaven. For whoſoever is not juſtified and pardoned here in this life, ſhall ſurely not attain it untill that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:167891:78"/> the labour of his anſwerer almoſt intolerable, to ſhew particularly how little each Scripture makes for him, and how much many of them againſt him; partly becauſe he doth ſtill reſerve to himſelf, [whatſoever be ſaid in anſwer] an advantage to evade, by telling us that the force of that Scripture doth in another way, and not in that to which we have anſwered, prove for him; but principally becauſe he quotes the ſame Scriptures over and over again in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place more proper, where it ſhall be more pertinent to anſwer them, I ſhall therefore here forbear to ſpeak to them, leſt I ſhould there be forced to omit it, or to ſay over again what had been here ſaid before: Nay himſelf will not have them to be anſwered here, for he ſpeaks ſo ambiguouſly, that he will not have his meaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, telling us onely that upon theſe Conditions (forſooth) performed, we ſhall be juſtified in another world, but doth not let us know from him whether upon performance of them we may be juſtified in the preſent world.

                           <p>I ſhall here propound ſome queſtions to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> about his own words to be anſwered by ſome of his Chaplains or Diſciples, For I am not ſo ambitious as to expect his ſtooping in perſon to ſo low an office. 1 Whether Chriſts ſatisfaction to the law were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and ſo virtually made, without an agreement between the Father and the Son, that the Son ſhould give, and the Father accept ſuch ſatisfaction? Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſo great a Maſter of reaſon, who hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed all his religion to reaſon, can judge whether this could ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally (if poſſibly) be done. 2 If by agreement whether this agreement was not by way of Covenant between the Father and the Son? and ſo whether the whole buſines of mans juſtification were not tranſacted and concluded upon, firſt between the Father and the Son? 3 Whether Chriſt undertook to give ſatisfaction or the Father to accept it for any other beſides thoſe that in time have or ſhall have the full benefit thereof? I mean, beſides the elect, whom the Son muſt perfectly know becauſe he was in the boſom of the Father, and was thorowly acquainted with all his boſom ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets? 4 Whether any one can miſſe of the benefit of this ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it is once ſo given and accepted for him by name? 5 Why Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſpeaking of the payment of this ſatisfaction, doth plainly mention the time when it was made, namely, the fullnes of time: in the very ſame breath ſpeaking of the undertaking, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and efficacy thereof, doth not alſo name the time when that was Covenanted and Concluded upon? Did he not ſee that it was needfull to the Compleating of this member of the ſentence, in a full equipage with the former, to name the time of this as well as of that? Was it a beare or an evill Conſcience in the way that put him to ſuch an Apoſiopeſis? that ſhook him into a dumbnes, when truth, honeſty and plain dealing bad him ſpeak out? Whether he had ſaid before all time, or ſhortly upon the beginning of time, he ſaw he ſhould have given a deathly wound, either to his Cauſe, or to his Credit, or to both; therefore like a cunning ſophiſter, ſtops his breath, and ſpeaks nothing. 6 And if the Covenant of grace, in all and every of its Articles were thus agreed upon between the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:167891:79"/> Father aad the Son, either before the actuall exiſtence of any man in the world, or as Mr. <hi>Br</hi> here Confeſſeth, before <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> the ſole perſons then exiſtent upon earth were treated with about it, how then doth he add, that he accounts him not worth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing, which tell us, that Chriſt was the onely party conditioned with, and that the New Covenant, as to us, hath no Conditions (ſo <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> &amp;c.) thus Caſting an Odium upon this opinion, as if Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> and his Diſciples alone held it, and that never any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him thought of it?</p>
                           <p>For my own part, where the Scriptures are ſilent, I am in great dread to be loquent; and where the word ſpeaketh ſparingly and darkly, I dare not to conclude too peremptorily. Neither in points that are controvertible in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but which way ſoever d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Every leaſt truth in Divinity is precious indeed, therefore not to be betrayed, but to be preſerved more carefully than our life &amp; bloud. Yet our life and bloud ought not to be ſo deer to us as the Peace of the Churches of Chriſt. And the diſturbing of the Churches peace may ſometimes more obſcure the honour of the Goſpel, than the ſuſpending of the defence of ſome not very important truths, for a while, could have done. I ſhould not therefore quarrell againſt them that aſcribe to the New Covenant its Condition, and make faith alone as it inſtrumentally receiveth Chriſt, the onely Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our being juſtified to and in our ſelves. I ſee not ſo great ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe upon the glory of Gods Grace or Chriſts merits cauſed by ſuch an aſſertion, that we ſhould diſturb the peace of the Churches about it, were it not that the Papiſts and Arminians by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturall phraſe do ſeek totally to corrupt the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheles Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> contumelious words ſhall not affright me from delivering my judgement what I think moſt probable, and moſt agreeing with holy Scripture touching the point in hand. Yet laying it down not as abſolute and certain, but as that which is yet moſt probable to me untill I ſhall by further enquiry into the Scriptures, or by the help of others, that have more enquired, ſee Cauſe to judge otherwiſe. As for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> though in humane literature, and in things ſubject to the tryall of reaſon, I hold his judgement not Contemptible, but equall with the moſt, yea the beſt; yet in Goſpel and ſpirituall things, I finde him ſo ſtupified,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:167891:80"/> perverted, and wholly ſpoyled with Philoſophy, ſeeing ſo little of the myſtery of Chriſt, yea ſo prejudiced againſt the ſacred things which he knowes not, that I account him one of thoſe whom the Apoſtle deſcribeth 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. Deſiring to be teachers of the Law, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. And therefore am ſo little affrighted from any doctrine of this kinde by his abaſing thereof, that I am the more induced to ſearch into it if it be not a pearl indeed, becauſe he hath trampled it. I ſhall then expreſs what I think in theſe following poſitions.</p>
                           <p>Firſt as God hath made two great and generall Covenants with mankind, each of them comprizing other &amp; leſſer Covenants under it: So becauſe there were not exiſtent perſonally (at the time of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe covenants) the ſingular individuals of mankind to whom theſe Covenants belonged, therefore did he appoint 2 publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, each of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> then exiſting when either Covenant was made, to be (as it were) repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatives of all the ſingular perſons, that then did or after ſhould exiſt to be under either Covenant, with whom when the Covenants were concluded, they ſhould be in perfect force for or againſt all that were repreſented in their ſeverall ages, as though they had been but then made particularly with them in their own perſons. The one of theſe Covenants is uſually termed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, the other the Covenant of grace. The publike or common perſon Covenanted with in the one was the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in the other the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. The caſe is cleer in reſpect of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenant of works. Mr. <hi>Br</hi> himſelf grants every inch of it. That whatſoever law or poſitive Commands were given to <hi>Adam,</hi> whatſoever promiſes in caſes of performance, or threats in caſe of breach, were added, all pertained as full to all the future progeny of <hi>Adam,</hi> as repreſented in him, and encloſed in his loins, as to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. And accordingly while <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood we ſtood in him, when he fell we fell in him and with him, as deep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of God as himſelf. I forbear to prove any of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is granted on all ſides. But the queſtion is wholly about Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whether the Covenant of grace was ſo made with him, as the Covenant of works with <hi>Adam?</hi> and what that Covenant of grace was? I conceive that both there was ſuch a Covenant between the Father and the Son in reference to us, and that this was the tenor thereof: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Son in time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhould aſſume to himſelf our nature, and in it repreſent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the elect that were equally ſinners and condemned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:167891:80"/> in <hi>Adam;</hi> that he ſhould offer himſelf in our fleſh a ſacrifice for ſinn; that upon his undertaking thereof the ſinns of all the elect ſhould be pardoned, and they of ſinners ſhould be made righteous, and delivered up into his hands, no more to be accounted to <hi>Adam,</hi> but to Chriſt, and to be preſerved in the boſom of his grace &amp; love to eternall glory. And (as Mr. <hi>Br</hi> acknowledgeth) upon Chriſts undertaking &amp;c. The ſatisfaction was ſo virtually and effectually made by Chriſt and accepted by the Father as when it was actually accompliſhed. Firſt it ſeems there was ſuch a Covenant; For the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. that <hi>Adam</hi> was a figure of him that was to come, which is Chriſt. And how a figure? Doubtles not onely in this that as by him the one and firſt man, ſin and death by ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came upon all men: ſo by Chriſt, righteouſnes, and by it life came upon all the elect: But alſo in the manner of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Type and Antitype together. That as <hi>Adam</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting all mankinde, by his unfaithfullnes in breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant brought ſin and death upon all that he repreſented: ſo Chriſt repreſenting all the elect, by his faithfullnes in performing the Covenant &amp;c. brought righteouſnes and juſtification of life upon all the elect repreſented in him. Yea the Holy Ghoſt in expreſſe words teſtifieth to ſuch a Covenant. <hi>In the volume of thy book it is written of me that I ſhould do thy will O God,</hi> ſaith he when he comes into the world, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is teſtified in the word what Covenant hath paſſed betwixt thee and me &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5-10. yea and teſtifieth to the tenor of the Covenant, his coming with a body to be offered in ſacrifice: this will of God he came to do. And moreover he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth witnes alſo to the faithfullnes of Chriſt in offering it, <hi>Lo I come;</hi> and to the efficacy of it upon all immediately for whom it was offered; By the which will we are ſanctified, <hi>i. e.</hi> no more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſinners, but Conſecrated as holy to the Lord through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, <hi>ibid.</hi> The ſame is implyed in that phraſe which here termeth the offering of Chriſts body <hi>the doing of the Fathers will.</hi> And elſwhere <hi>obedience unto death even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 8.

For them whoſe names were written in the book of life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. The reſt things conteined in this poſition are granted by Mr. <hi>Br</hi> himſelfe, therefore need no proof here. I have couched together many things in this, to avoyd multiplicity of poſitions.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 That by force of this ſatisfaction ſo given and accepted for the ſinns of the Elect, according to the Tenor of this Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, all the Elect of God were Juſtified in Chriſt from the very time of Chriſts undertaking to be their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier. Therefore in the laſt alleaged Scripture their names are ſaid to be written in the book of life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world. Here though the book of life which is elſwhere mentioned to be Gods book will be taken by Mr. <hi>Br</hi> to be the book of Election, yet this book of life of the lamb is to be underſtood for the book of Juſtification, implying indeed the election of all that are written therein, but primarily and in its direct ſenſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the names of them that are juſtified by the bloud of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Lamb of God. And theſe are ſaid to be written in Chriſts book, that is regiſtred in Chriſt, and upon Chriſts account from the foundation of the world, immediately upon Chriſts undertaking to ſatisfie for them. <hi>Of him ye are in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>who of God is made unto us Wiſdome, Righteouſnes, Sanctification and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. When was he ſo made unto us? Mr. <hi>Br</hi> anſwereth, not onely upon the payment but upon his undertaking to pay our debt. Therefore is he ſaid to be <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. And that not onely in reference to them that lived in all ages of the world, but in reſpect of us alſo, that in all ages of the world he hath been, and will be what now he is our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:167891:81"/> our Chriſt. But this poſition hath been before proved in the former Chapter, in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Baxters 13 Theſis</hi> and its expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, where I ſpake to his ſixth Argument.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 The Miniſteriall way of offering and convaying the benefits of Chriſts ſatisfaction into the ſouls and apprehenſions of men, now uſed under the Goſpel, according to the command of Chriſt, is or at leaſt ſounds like an inferior Covenant, ſubordinate and ſub-ſervient to this between the Father and the Son, whereof we have ſpoken. Chriſt having now made full ſatisfaction to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, invites all, and brings in his elect, to taſte and enjoy by faith all the perfections which he hath merited and received into his hands for them. It is confeſſed by Mr. <hi>B. Theſ. 8. That God is ſo fully pleaſed with the Sons undertaking of this buſines of Mediation, that he hath delivered all things into his hands, and given him all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth, and made him Lord both of the dead and living. And the Lord Jeſus himſelf affirmeth, that the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son,</hi> i. e. <hi>the diſpenſation and ordering of all things in heaven and in earth.</hi> And it is the opinion of great Divines, that the Lord Chriſt in the old world before the Law, and in all ages under the Law, being that perſon of the Trinity, which had undertaken to aſſume our nature unto him, and in it to dye for the reconciling of us to God, and entring from the beginning upon his power, to ſet in order all things to this glorious end; was he that converſed with the Patriarks and Prophets, ſometimes in an aſſumed body like a man, ſometimes inviſibly, making known the myſtery of Redemption by himſelf to them, and preſcribing under what adminiſtrations he would have his Church governed untill his coming. That it was he who firſt preached to <hi>Adam</hi> ſalvation by the ſeed of the Woman, and afterward more cleerly to <hi>Abraham.</hi> That it was he alſo which delivered the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and added there a ſecond Covenant, in ſhew and ſound a meer Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, (<hi>Do and be Bleſſed, Sin and be Curſed</hi>) which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alone is expreſly called the Old Covenant, and is indeed now repealed, and aboliſhed from being any more a Covenant, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them that put themſelves under it. This was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Covenant, an Appendix to the Covenant before made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and both this and that with <hi>Abraham</hi> were but ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Covenants to that before mentioned between God and Chriſt. Here now all that were juſtified before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, were juſtified in Chriſt by force of the firſt Covenant made between
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:167891:82"/> the Father and the Son. The promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with the Iſraelites, together with all the Sacraments and ſignes annexed to all theſe, tended onely to bring them that were juſtified before in Chriſt to a reall and ſenſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of it and the comforts thereof, by Faith within their own conſciences: So is it now under the Goſpel adminiſtration, That firſt Covenant is that by which our juſtification is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed in Chriſt; the preaching of Faith in a Covenant way, tends onely to this, that as many as were before juſtified in Chriſt, may by Faith have their Juſtification declared and evidenced to their conſciences, to fill them with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, and with that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding. Not but that Chriſt could without any ſuch Sub-Covenanting have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up his elect with all the marrow and myſtery of Juſtification, by immediate Revelation from himſelf, as he dealt with <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle: but that this way made moſt for his and his Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Faith it ſelf, (much leſs any other qualification, gift or act) is not a condition of Juſtification <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> there Chriſt hath pleaded our diſcharge by his blood, &amp; ſtill maketh interceſſion for us, but a means or inſtrument by which we receive Chriſt Jeſus, and the righteouſnes or juſtification that is in him to our ſelves for conſolation and ſalvation, <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> ſo ſtood the caſe in reſpect of the fore-mentioned under Covenant that of the Law. When the Lord Chriſt had publiſhed his Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> all his Judgments and Statutes, there now paſſeth a ſolemn Covenant betwixt Chriſt and them, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo every one in perſon aſſenting gladly; to fulfill all that they might be bleſſed, or if in the leaſt point they ſhould fail, to yeeld themſelves curſed. This Covenant was made more viſibly and in every part more ſtrictly after the nature and rule of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, then this under the Goſpel. Yet will any ſay that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience ſo Covenanted, was a condition of their juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation, without which none could be juſtified or ſaved: Then were all damned, for no one either did or could perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Nay <hi>it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 3. 19. i. e.</hi> as a means ſo to operate about ſin in the diſcovery of it, and the damnation that is by it, ſo alſo to convince men that they might be driven from all ſuppoſition of their own righteouſnes, and ſeek righteouſnes by Chriſt alone, in whom alone the elect were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:167891:82"/> juſtified before this Covenant was made. In the ſame manner the holding forth of juſtification now under the Goſpel, in the form and likenes of a Covenant; <hi>Beleeve and be ſaved, beleeve not and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever:</hi> proveth not Faith to be the condition of the New Covenant, (as hath been ſaid) even the whole preaching of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, and injoyning of Faith upon all to receive it, is an effect of that Firſt great Covenant of Grace between the Father and the Son, and a part of Chriſts Propheticall Office which he undertook in that Covenant to accompliſh, in undertaking the Mediatorſhip between God and Men. An effect of that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I ſay. For ſo it was agreed that <hi>All which the Father had given to Chriſt,</hi> by him to be juſtified and ſaved, <hi>ſhould come to him,</hi> i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, <hi>Jo:</hi> 6. 37. To this purpoſe it was Covenanted on the Sons part, <hi>to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Luke 19. 10. to call unto him all to participate by Faith of the life, light, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation that he had received for them, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Io: 7. 37. Ma.</hi> 11. 28. This was a part of his Propheticall Office, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the treaſures of Grace in his heart, and to envite all to the participation thereof. And then on the Fathers part it was Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted that he would draw to Chriſt all the Elect, all that he had given to Chriſt, that while the Goſpel ſounded in their ears, he would divinely by his Spirit teach and move their hearts, that they ſhall not but come to Chriſt, <hi>Jo:</hi> 6. 43, 44. And laſtly it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on the Sons part again, that of all that the Father thus bringeth to him, he muſt caſt out none, loſe none, but raiſe them all at the laſt day [to glorification] and the reaſon of all is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, <hi>It is the Fathers will, i. e.</hi> that which was Covenanted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and him in Heaven, and he came down from Heaven, not to do his own will, <hi>i. e.</hi> any thing of his private will, without the conſent of his Father, <hi>but the will of him that ſent him, i. e.</hi> what was Covenanted between the Father and him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current with the will of both, <hi>Jo:</hi> 6. 37, 38, 39. Thus all that which Mr <hi>B.</hi> calleth the Covenant of Grace, is but an effect or an Article and branch of the Covenant made of old between God and Chriſt. And Faith not ſo properly termed a condition of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as an inſtrument to apprehend the preſent comfort of it, being before ours in Chriſt.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>That Text of <hi>Jer: 31. 31, 32, 33, &amp;c.</hi> opened, and Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> eluſions by which he would evince that it proveth not a free and unconditionall Covenant anſwered: with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argumentations with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> about the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Now come to that Teſtimony of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. cited in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8-10. againſt which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo much excepteth. That New Covenant there mentioned is called the New Covenant, not in oppoſition to the Old Covenant made in the beginning with <hi>Adam,</hi> but in oppoſition to that Covenant made two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred years after at leaſt, with <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> And that Covenant upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> is called the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not in oppoſition to the Cov: of Grace made [if not from eternity according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> yet] by Mr <hi>B.</hi> acknowledgment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 3000 years before, and in thoſe thouſands of years oft held out afreſh and renewed: but in oppoſition to the Covenant of Grace as it is now held forth in a new form and adminiſtration under the Goſpel. So that the two Covenants there mentioned, are termed Old and New, not for their differing in ſubſtance, but for their different wayes of adminiſtration. The Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> then, and the Churches of Chriſt now, are and were under the ſame Covenant of Grace in ſubſtance; but the Church then under a legall and the Church now under an Evangelicall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adminiſtration thereof. That was the old, this the new admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and in reſpect hereof the ſame Covenant then and now, are termed the Old and New Covenant. This is evident from the Text, <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that in thoſe dayes I will make a New Covenant with [them] not ſuch as I made with their Fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>which my Covenant they brake, though I were an Husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this is the Covenant that I will make with [them] in thoſe dayes, I will put my Lawes in their minds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will be their God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſnes, and their ſins and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will I remember no more.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> muſt</p>
                        <p>1 Grant that the Old Covenant in this place mentioned, was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:167891:83"/> the Covenant of the Law given in the Wildernes. For this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed where it is ſaid to be <hi>made with their Fathers when the Lord took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt.</p>
                        <p>And 2 Notwithſtanding <hi>Iſrael</hi> being under the Covenant, they were not either wholly under a Covenant of works, or beſides the Covenant of Grace. For the Apoſtle maketh theſe two phraſes, to be <hi>Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Strangers from the Covenant of Promiſe,</hi> to ſound one and the ſame thing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. and telleth us <hi>that the Law</hi> which was 430 years after, <hi>could not null the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, ſo as to make the Promiſe of no effect:</hi> but that after the addition of this Legall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that Goſpel Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> him, of bleſſednes by Chriſt the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſtood firm unto them ſtill, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. This alſo will doubtles be granted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That therefore the Goſpel Covenant in this Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is called a New Covenant, not in oppoſition to that made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for that is the ſame with this here promiſed, onely that was confirmed of God in Chriſt to come, this in Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come; and yet in oppoſition to that legall adminiſtration of it, and additory Covenant of the Law 430 years after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That this additionall Covenant was that Pedagogy of the Law under which the Apoſtle affirmeth the <hi>Jewes</hi> (though Lords of all) to be kept untill the coming of Chriſt, in the third and fourth chapters to the <hi>Galathians.</hi> And it conſiſted partly of Ceremoniall Lawes and typicall Ordinances pointing to Chriſt that was to come, and obſcurely teaching Chriſt and Faith in him: partly of the Morall Commandments, the obſervation whereof was injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a condition of attaining that bleſſednes before promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt, yet ſo as this condition, <hi>If ye will obey,</hi> was ſtill in the hand of a Mediator, ſatisfying for diſobedience, becauſe no perfect obedience could be fulfilled. This Pedagogy or leading of the Jewiſh Church by the hand while it was a child in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the myſtery of ſalvation by Chriſt was needfull, it could not well be without the typicall Ordinances, which by Lectures read upon them by their teachers, might diſcover and ſeal up much of Chriſt to them. Neither could it well be without the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threats of the Law, while yet the Grace of the Lord Chriſt was veiled to them, that in the light joy and brightnes thereof they could not as the Saints now run the race of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:167891:84"/> of pure love without ſome mixture of ſervile fear.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 It will hence then follow that the New Covenant here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is termed a new Covenant, becauſe exempted from that additament of the Law.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 From the Ceremoniall Law, which in its revealing of Chriſt veiled him, and let out but a dark ſhadow of him and the grace that is by him, ſo that there was need of a large expoſition upon every figure, Circumciſion, Paſſeover, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Brother to teach Brother, and one Neighbour another what theſe things meant, and yet at laſt both teachers and learners remained exceeding dark in the myſtery of Chriſt. But it is otherwiſe with us under the Goſpel. <hi>The ſhaddowes are vaniſhed and we have the very body which is Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 17. <hi>Our eyes have ſeen, we have heard with our ears, and our hands have handled the bread of life,</hi> 1 Joh: 1. 1. All is made out to us cleerly by the Doctrine and Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>The Law</hi> (by which the Prophet ſpeaking in the tone of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and in a phraſe which under that adminiſtration they beſt knew, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the Goſpel and Law of the Spirit of life) <hi>is written in our hearts, revealed and ſealed up to our Conſciences.</hi> We need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend up to Heaven, or who ſhall diſcend to the deep?</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart, this is the word of Faith which we preach,</hi> Rom. 10. 6-8. So that there is not ſo much need of brothers teaching brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe all is held forth not in the ſhadow but in the clear light.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 From the conditions of the morall Law, yea from all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which made that former adminiſtration of the Covenant terrible, becauſe conditions could not be performed. The New Covenant ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall be abſolute, not ſuch as was made with their Fathers, that might be broken; but free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, all begun and ended by the meer grace of God, <hi>I will teach,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to their unrighteouſnes, and their ſins and iniquity will I remember no more.</hi> I am not ſo happy as to expreſs my ſelf in few words, nor ſo either reckles, or evilly ſubtle, as under a pretence of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to leave things in ambiguity for ſelf-ends. This I conceive to be the meaning of this text, and in theſe five Poſitions I have (<hi>ſub calculo melioris judicij</hi>) expreſſed what yet I conceive to be the truth about the Covenant of Grace, 1 between God and Chriſt, 2 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and man.</p>
                        <p>To this laſt thing handled, that the Covenant of Grace in its
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:167891:84"/> preſent adminiſtration is free and not conditionall, otherwiſe then I have before granted, the Apoſtle giveth purpoſely his ſuffrage, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is that which now ſtands in force, that the Law was but a temporary additament to it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main onely till the promiſed ſeed ſhould come, he means ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as to make the Covenant conditionall. The Law therefore being in this reſpect done away, the Covenant abides free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. <hi>In thee, in thy ſeed, all Nations ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> Gal. 3. 8, 16, 17, 18. This Covenant is free, abſolute, laden with no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as might make the hope of bleſſednes uncertain.</p>
                        <p>The evaſions which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> uſeth to elude the authority of this Scripture, are meerly Sophiſticall, having no footing upon other Scriptures, and totally croſſing the purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture. <hi>It conteineth not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the full tenor of the whole New Covenant.</hi> Where then ſhall we find it, if not where the Holy Ghoſt undertaketh profeſſedly to declare both what this New Covenant is not, and what it is? <hi>This is the Covenant</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Nay it is but a peece or morſell of it,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> whom ſhall we beleeve? him that ſpeaketh from Heaven, or him that (at the beſt) ſpeaketh but from the earth? <hi>But either ſo called</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Br.) becauſe it expreſſeth the nature of the benefits of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as they are offered on Gods part, without mentioning mans conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (that being not pertinent to the buſineſs the Prophet had in hand.</hi>) A moſt impudent fiction, yea it was the whole or chief thing he had in hand; was it not to ſhew the difference between theſe two under-covenants, that under the Law, and this under the Goſpel? But how doth it ſerve to this purpoſe to expreſſe the nature of the benefits of the New Covenant? Did not the Elect under the Law partake of the ſame benefits in nature though not in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with the Elect now? Or is not this one of the differences which he makes betwixt the Covenants, that the one was hedged about with hard conditions, the other free? <hi>Or els,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it ſpeaketh onely of what God will do for his Elect, in giving them the firſt grace, and enabling them to perform the New Covenant.</hi> Ridiculous; though right in the Monkes tone. For did not God give the firſt and ſecond Grace too, to the Elect under the Law as well as to the Elect under the Goſpel? Where then is the difference hence, to give a new name to the preſent Covenant? <hi>But laſtly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and belongs to the will of purpoſe, not to his legiſlative will.</hi> Now he hits the nail upon the head. He makes a very Aſſe of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:167891:85"/> and loads him with all ſorts of traſh. It is to be doubted it will ſhortly get a gawld back, and kick his Maſter in the leggs. Predictions and Promiſes, becauſe they are not perteining to Gods legiſlative will, muſt henceforth give neither fulture to our faith nor light to our judgments. The reſt that he hath upon this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis hath nothing of moment in it calling for an anſwer.</p>

                        <p>I annex this Poſition becauſe it is homogeneous with the many former, and though Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> would ſeem in the Explication to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the matter of it from that which the former Aphoriſms conteined, yet is it not onely of the ſame kinde but of the ſame ſubſtance alſo with it, and what hath been ſaid in anſwer to that which went before might ſuffice as an anſwer to this alſo. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it delights him to ſpeak the ſame things in a variation of words, let us ſee whether the words which he here uſeth have more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>fficacy in them to his purpoſe then the former.</p>
                        <p>We finde here as we did in ſome of the former Theſes, a fardle of ambiguities, and phraſes of a doubtfull ſenſe, which puts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an uncapacity of anſwering his meaning, becauſe he ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he will be ſure we ſhall not be able to prove what is his meaning.</p>
                        <p>Firſt when he ſaith, <hi>It is not the will of Chriſt, or will of the Father,</hi> he leaves us unreſolved whether he mean the will of purpoſe or the will of precept, that if we anſwer to the one, he may evade by a pretence he meant the other. If he will be underſtood of the former, when was he rapt up into the third Heaven to ſearch what ſecret purpoſes and decrees are hidden in the boſom of the Father or of the Son? Or if he hath it by revelation, why doth he not ſhew how and when it was given him, and whether in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or extraordinary manner? Or if he mean that will, how ſhall he take it up to be the rule of his judgment, which in the very laſt words to which I anſwered, and ſo often elſwhere, he abandoneth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:167891:85"/> from being the rule of other mens judgments? If he mean the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the will of precept, why holds he us ſuſpended in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of alleaging the precept, and arguing forth his Concluſions thence, that if ſatisfactory we may ſubmit to it, if otherwiſe we may except againſt it?</p>
                        <p>Secondly when he tels us of Juſtification denying any living ſoul to have it only by Chriſts ſatisfaction, without ſome ground in himſelf of particular right and claim thereto, and except it be alſo received and applyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he leaves us doubtfull whether he meaneth Juſtification as compleated in Chriſt, or as evidenced alſo to our own conſciences. If the former what will he then conclude of periſhing or dying infants, that they are all unjuſtified, and in reſpect of the puniſhment of loſs remedileſly damned, and ſo with his brethren ſhut them up for ever in that dark priſon which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them <hi>Limbus infantum?</hi> If the latter, and that he will give us leave to take his words in Scripture-ſenſe, we will not quarrel with them; but this in the Explication he ſeems to explode.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly when he tels us of ſome grounds of claim in our ſelves to Juſtification, which in the following words he ſeems to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate to conſiſt in <hi>our receiving and applying thereof,</hi> and in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>p.</hi> 93. he calls <hi>ſomwhat of man intervening to give him a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall right to it,</hi> annexing that we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith; in all this he mixeth together falſhood and ſubtilty with his ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: putting himſelf into that poſture wherein the Papiſts have painted and feigned <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> hovering between Heaven and Hell, ſometimes mounting on high, ſometimes ſinking low again, but pitching neither above, nor beneath. In ſuch a motion we here find Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as he is in his gradation further making out the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Romiſh iniquity for a Law, ſoaring ſtill higher towards the very top of it, and ſinking lower from the Orb of Chriſtian veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? So by that ſomething of man that muſt enright him to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, he muſt mean ſomething more then Repentance and Faith, which he had before concluded neceſſary to Juſtification, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 14. Els were he upon a retreating not a marching poſture. Nevertheles how ſubtlely doth he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>wb and paint to gull the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and catch them that are made to be taken, by putting fine words upon his courſe purpoſes, telling them that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> and <hi>that there is required on our part but receiving and applying of Chriſts merits;</hi> as if he were as innocent as a Dove, and had none of the Serpent in him; when contrariwiſe the ſequele of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:167891:86"/> proclaimes him, by that which he calls here ſomewhat of man, to mean at the full with the worſt Papiſts, mans works to the totall excluſion of Gods grace. In mean while his words leave it doubtfull here what this ſomewhat of man is, and whether it be the hand or the heel that muſt receive and apply Chriſt to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? His Diſciples are not yet enough moulded (he thinks) to receive the Dragons voice in his own tone; they muſt be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bear the Calf daily untill he become an Oxe that he may be born then too, and at length we ſhall finde the inſtruments which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> appoints to receive Chriſt, to be inſtrumentall onely to puſh him from us. However he concludes thus (becauſe he will have it ſo) <hi>That no man by the meer ſatisfaction made, is freed from the Law and Curſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>abſolutely, but conditionally onely,</hi> i. e. not at all. And this he hath ſaid over and over already, and there needs no further Anſwer then that which hath been before given: So that where he repeats this Aſſertion again in the Explication, <hi>That Chriſt doth not juſtifie by the ſhedding of his blood immediately, without ſomwhat of man intervening,</hi> &amp;c. adding that <hi>All the Scriptures allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> p. 79. <hi>do prove it.</hi> I grant what he ſaith, for I finde no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there alleaged. But if he mean <hi>p.</hi> 89, &amp; 90. what I ſaid there I ſay here again, he ſhall not miſſe of an anſwer to them when he comes to alleage them again in their proper place, and declares how he will argue from them. Yet becauſe the man is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver firſt in generall what he will after deliver again in particulars, I ſhall ſay ſomething alſo in generall to his generall aſſertion, That Chriſts ſatisfaction juſtifieth not without <hi>ſomething of man intervening to give him right to it.</hi> Let us ſee what the Scripture ſaith for or againſt it.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking of mans redemption and juſtification, and ſhewing the cauſe why ſome have, and ſome have not their part in it, affirmeth and proveth, that <hi>it is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9. 16. By the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is to be underſtood all the good qualifications and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoul; by running all the good works of a mans life and practice, as all confeſs. When the Holy Ghoſt excludeth every ſomewhat of man within the man, and every ſomewhat of man without man, from conferring any thing to Juſtification, what other ſomewhat remaineth of man to intervene, &amp;c? Let it be judged whether Mr. B. doth not purpoſely fight againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:167891:86"/>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Rom. 5. 6, 8, 9, 10. When we were yet without ſtrength,</hi> (viz. to any ſpirituall operation) <hi>Chriſt dyed for the ungodly, while we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us, and we were juſtified by his bloud: while enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Here the Reſult of the Apoſtles reaſoning diſcovers to us two things to our purpoſe. 1 That according to the minde and language of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Chriſt dying,</hi> and by his death <hi>ſatisfying</hi> for any mans ſinns, and that mans <hi>juſtification, and reconciliation to God</hi> by that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, are equipollent terms, holding forth one and the ſame thing. For ſo the Apoſtle here uſeth juſtification and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as words of the ſame ſenſe and weight. And <hi>Ameſius</hi> manifeſteth<note place="margin">Ameſ Med. Lib. 1. c. 27. Sect. 22.</note> in what reſpects they muſt needs be taken for the ſame thing, and makes both the ſame with Chriſts dying for him. So that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whom Chriſt hath by his death made ſatisfaction, is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally juſtified and reconciled to God (I mean) in Chriſt, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly not yet in his own apprehenſion. 2 That we are thus juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and reconciled to God, while ungodly, while ſinners, while enemies, while without ſtrength to that which is good. What <hi>ſomewhat of man</hi> can there be in ſuch, to enright them to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs any will ſay, their impotency, ungodlines, ſin and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhall do it? Such contrariety is there between Mr. <hi>Br</hi> and the Spirit or word of truth. There needs not much deliberation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which to follow. But he proceeds,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax. p. 93.</hi> Let all the Antinomians ſhew but one Scripture which ſpeaks of Juſtification from Eternity.</q>
                        <p>And what if it be but one of all, or one that is not an Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian that ſhews it, will Mr. <hi>Br</hi> harken and ſubmit his judgement to that Scripture ſo alleaged? I ſay in like manner: Let all the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Jeſuits, or Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> or his M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Grotius,</hi> ſhew one Scripture which aſſerteth onely a conditionall and not an abſolute Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchaſed to us by Chriſt, I will hear and ſubmit, though I ſee not then how to be ſaved. As to his Challenge I ſhall ſpeak in a more proper place.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> I know God hath decreed to juſtifie his people from eternity, and ſo he hath to ſanctifie them too, but both of them are done in time: Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being no more an immanent act in God, than ſanctification: as I ſhall ſhew afterward.</q>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore wait on him untill he hath the leiſure and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſhew it. In the mean while, why doth he Conclude ſo hotly and peremptorily before-hand that which he brings nothing ſave
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:167891:87"/> his own bare affirmation to prove. He ſaid not unwiſely which ſaid; <hi>Let not him that girdeth on his armour boaſt as he that putteth it off, 1 King.</hi> 20. 11.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> The bloud of Chriſt then is ſufficient <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> but not <hi>in omni genere;</hi> ſufficient for its own work, but not for every work. There are ſeverall other neceſſaries to Juſtifie and ſave, <hi>quibus poſitis,</hi> which being ſuppoſed, the bloud of Chriſt will be effectuall.</q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Qui non vult intelligi debet negligi.</hi> He that will ſo ſpeak that he may not be underſtood, is worthy to paſs without an Anſwer. If he mean that the bloud of Chriſt is ſufficient to compleat our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, and that this is its own work; But that there are other neceſſaries to juſtifie us in our ſelves and our own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which being ſuppoſed the work is ended; I will abſtein from all contradiction. If he mean otherwiſe, and will not expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Hony ſoit Qui male penſe.</hi>

Not that it receives its efficacy from theſe, nor that theſe do add any thing at all to its worth and value, no more than the cabbinett to the jewell, or the applying hand to the Medicine, or the offenders acceptation to the pardon of his Prince. Yet without this acceptation and application, this bloud will not be effectuall to juſtifie us.</q>
                        <p>Theſe words would ſeem to plead a good meaning in Mr. <hi>Br</hi> to them that neither are acquainted with the glozings of the Papiſts, nor with that which followeth in this Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> He might be thought by this his ſmoothing to attribute our Juſtification wholly to Chriſts ſufferings, and nothing to any thing in our ſelves, ſave to faith only, nor to Faith, but as it is appointed of God to be inſtrumentall for the accepting and receiving into our boſoms Chriſts merits and the benefits thereof. The like fine words we ſhall finde oft falling from the pen of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> Papiſts, Arminians, &amp;c.

                        <p>The ſumme of all is this. Becauſe our juſtification is an act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the meer and free will of God and of Chriſt, it was therefore in their power, after payment made by Chriſt, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Father in our behalf, to covenant, and accompliſh our diſcharge, either forthwith or a long time after, either ſimply or upon Conditions. Therefore it is Covenanted between the Father and the Son that we ſhall be, after ſatisfaction made, not forthwith, but in proceſſe of time, juſtified, and then alſo not purely or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely but conditionally. A mad Argumentation. For <hi>A poſſe ad eſſe non valet Conſequentia.</hi> It is as if I ſhould argue God could have ſupported Mr. <hi>Br</hi> and his M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> in the truth of the Goſpel. <hi>Ergo</hi> he hath preſerved them in the truth. What judicious man that hath conſiderately read their works, would not hiſſe at ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? But he adds the authority of <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

                        <p>O that Mr. <hi>Br</hi> had ſtood as <hi>Auſtin,</hi> pillar-like to beare up the Grace of God entire in the whole buſines of our ſalvation, againſt all the ſophiſms of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers.

                        <p>Yet the ſentence it ſelf alleaged out of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> (I doubt) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as it hath been by ſome before him. I have been told that in <hi>Auſtin</hi> it is read intorrogatively; and bears the force of an affirmative, thus; <hi>He that made thee without thee, will he not ſave thee without thee?</hi> which is equivolent to this (if it were ſaid) <hi>he will ſave thee without thee.</hi> For the truth of it I have been directed to his Serm. 11. <hi>de verb.

                        <p>The one part of Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> Goſpel we have found, in the former part of this Tractate, the ſumme and ſubſtance whereof may be thus expreſſed; That Chriſt Jeſus by the will of his Father, hath by the ſatisfaction made to juſtice for the ſins of the Elect, obteined that the whole Curſe and managing thereof, together with the Elect for whom he hath ſatisfied, ſhould be delivered up into his hand: And he ſheweth himſelf in this his power an <hi>unmercifull High Prieſt,</hi> holding his redeemed ones, under the Curſe, wrath, and torment in ſoul and body, not giving them deliverance untill the day of judgement. He did ſomewhat before look unto, but now really enters upon the ſecond part, which is like to the former, holding forth a juſtification in the world to come, upon ſuch Conditions as will not bring any unto, but certainly exclude all, that to this end uſe and perform them, from juſtification into condemnation. Within the Confines of theſe two eſſentiall parts of his Goſpel, he comprizeth all the riches of grace by Chriſt, which whoſoever likes it, may if he will, partake of. Such have we already found the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt part of his Goſpel. We are now to examine whether the ſecond part thereof be not ſuch as I have here mentioned; if not, I have wronged Mr. <hi>Br;</hi> if ſo, he wrongs Chriſt, and works againſt him ſeeking the damnation of the Elect. And by the very words of theſe four propoſitions of his, (if nothing els were to be added) he that is both orthodox and judicious, may ſomewhat judge whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Br</hi> driveth, finding him to ſet up mans righteouſnes paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell with Chriſts righteouſnes, and equally neceſſary to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo making man at leaſt a demiſaviour to himſelf, and ſo (in effect prove) an abſolute deſtroyer of his own ſoul.

So Mr. <hi>Br</hi> taking notice of ſome affected wits that had rather periſh and dye for ever by Art, &amp; that which is falſely called <hi>Science</hi> or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. than to live and be ſaved by the ſimplicity and plainnes of the Goſpel; compoſeth himſelf wholly to pleaſe their humour, and make himſelf their darling; handles the Caſe ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and artificially, that he may kill them ſoftly, they never feeling it untill they are dead and ruined for ever.</p>
                        <p>One peece of his artifice we have here in his invention of that twofold Righteouſnes of the two Covenants abſolutely neceſſary to juſtification or ſalvation: The one in Chriſt, the other in our ſelves: Chriſts righteouſnes purchaſing for us a conditionall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, a poſſibility of righteouſnes &amp; bliſs in the world to come; but the other, our righteouſnes when once finiſhed and compleated, being that which doth the deed and drives the nail to the head, making both Chriſts righteouſneſs and the juſtification purchaſed by it, to be no longer Conditionally, but actually and really ours. Provided and alwayes excepted that this cannot be in this life, and ſo the tryall of Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> doctrine by experience, can never be made untill this world be wholly ended.</p>
                        <p>This is learning indeed, ſuch as neither the dictates of men, (at leaſt <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in ſo fine a contexture of words) nor the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God could ever teach Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> It is his own and poſſibly may continue his onely to the worlds end, all men els proving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too wiſe or too fooliſh to joyn with him in this his ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We thought that the righteouſneſs according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under which God hath placed us, had ſufficed to juſtification; he tells us nay, but we are under both the Covenant of works and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:167891:90"/> the Covenant of grace too, and muſt be righteous in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of both. The world had not the wit untill now, nor yet Chriſt, or any of his Prophets or Apoſtles had it ever in their Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to term Chriſt our legall, and our own works and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons our Goſpel righteouſnes: Mr. <hi>Br</hi> firſt having received it rough hewen from Papiſts and Arminians, teacheth us this piece of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctionary learning. Neither did it enter ever into our thoughts that the righteouſneſs of the Old Covenant was of a more noble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Nevertheles it behoved Mr. <hi>Br</hi> having reſolved to keep on the triple Crown upon the Popes head, by ſtabliſhing juſtification upon works, (though it were to the uncrowning of Chriſt,) to reject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes and to ſeek after inventions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. Firſt he muſt hold beleevers to be under both Covenants, els while he builds up one peece of Babylon, he ſhould pluck down another; and give his judgment againſt his holines in one point, while he acts the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for him in another: and adventure with all the loſs of his Cauſe, if he keep not as ſtrong hold-faſt in the Covenant of works with the one hand, as in the Covenant of grace with the other. 2 He muſt call the Condition or means of applying Chriſt to us or obteining intereſt in his ſatisfaction, our Righteouſnes, els he will not be able to evade thoſe Scriptures which aſſert our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith. But by this feat he thinks himſelf in a fit poſture both to anſwer this, and to bring in all qualifications and works that he pleaſeth in a partnerſhip with faith to juſtifie. True (will he ſay) we are juſtified by Faith as a part of our righteouſnes, and by all other good qualifications and works as other parts of our righteouſnes. 3 He muſt call faith and works our Evangelicall righteouſnes, having ſeen in what a ſtinking trance ſome of his dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deer brethren in their diſputes have been left, when they would prove that good works as works of the Law do juſtifie: and how little better they have fared, who would have them to juſtifie onely as works of grace, having not had enough ſubtlety to prove them Goſpel or Grace works. Need had he therefore to put himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrong and ſtrange inventions that himſelf may not ſtick in the ſame mire after them. But enough in generall, let us hear him deliver his own minde in particulars.</p>

                        <p>Here we finde Mr. <hi>Br</hi> at the very top of his gallantry and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; moſt probably his fancy had ſuggeſted to him a totall rout of all terrene animals at the ſound of his precedent glorying, and polemicall argumentation; as if therefore all this viſible world were Conquered, and he were marching out of it in triumph, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not a dogg being left to move his tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: he now challengeth the Heavens, and Calls the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ad partes,</hi> to Come to a reckoning for the impropriety of language which he uſeth by his penmen in the Scriptures. For when he ſaith, <hi>I know that the obſervance of the Law of Ceremonies, and the ſeeking of Life by the works of the Law, are both commonly called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Righteouſnes, and that Chriſts legall righteouſneſs imputed to us is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Evangelicall Righteouſneſs:</hi> he muſt needs mean primarily that theſe are ſo Called Commonly in holy Scriptures, and but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily that they are ſo called by Eccleſiaſticall Writers, as they derive from the Scriptures a Chaſte Scripture phraſe wherein to expreſſe ſpirituall doctrines, For ſo the Scripture mentioneth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two kinds of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that ever Came or ſhall Come into Competition about our Juſtification, the one a legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or righteouſneſs of the Law, the other the Evangelicall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, or righteouſnes of the Goſpel. The legall Righteouſneſs it <hi>affirms to be a righteouſneſs of works which we have done,</hi> i. e. of good qualifications within us, and good operations flowing from us;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:167891:93"/> the Evangelicall righteouſneſs to be <hi>of meer grace and mercy,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. The latter it terms <hi>Gods Righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. that which God giveth and imputeth; the former <hi>our own righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. which is wrought within our ſelves, and acted by our ſelves, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. That of the Law, <hi>a Righteouſnes of works,</hi> this of the Goſpel, <hi>a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs without works,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. That a <hi>Righteouſneſs in our ſelves, inherent,</hi> This <hi>a Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, imputed,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Or let Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſhew any one Scripture that terms the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is in and by Chriſt a legall, or that which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our ſelves an Evangelicall Righteouſneſs: or that terms any gift or qualification in man, or work and deed of man his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, any peece of his righteouſneſs unto Juſtification. So that his quarrell here is againſt the Holy Ghoſt for ſpeaking ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and incongruouſly in Scriptures, and Calling the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is by Chriſt Evangelicall, and the righteouſneſs which is in our ſelves Legall Righteouſneſs. But how will he Confute the Holy Ghoſt, and prove an abſurdity and impropriety in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Holy Ghoſt? Forſooth, by oppoſing himſelf, his own authority and learning, to the Holy Ghoſt, and his wiſdome and authority. Himſelf he affirms to ſpeak logically, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>ſtrictly and properly,</hi> But the Holy Ghoſt is no ſcholar, never read <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> therefore ſpeaks rudely, ruſtically, like one of the Rural Animals, not as an Artiſt out of the ſchools. Himſelf gives (ſcholar-like) <hi>a denomination to theſe two Righteouſneſſes, from that Covenant which is their Rule, from the Formall Reaſon of the thing:</hi> But the Holy Ghoſt for lack of ſchool-learning, gives names thereunto from more <hi>Alien Extrinſecall reſpects.</hi> This is the ſumme of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. And is it not poſſible to requeſt from Mr. <hi>Br</hi> that he would take the Holy Ghoſt a while as a pupill into his Tuition, to read unto him ſome Logicall Lectures by which he may be inſtructed to mould a new the Scriptures into another, a Logical, inſteed of that ſpirituall and Celeſtiall phraſe in which we now finde them? Or if the Spirit of truth and wiſdom ſhould be the Teacher, not the Schollar of Mr. <hi>Br,</hi> then may we break out into Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Br, Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if there were no more to be ſeen in his ſufferings, he ſhould not have been our righteouſnes either Legall or Evangelicall. For what merit could there be in a ſuffering of Conſtraint and Compulſion? But when in his ſufferings he was a voluntary agent, <hi>Called and Conſecrated by the Father to be our Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 5. 5. <hi>No man taking his life from him, but himſelf laying it down of himſelf, for us and in our ſtead,</hi> Joh. 10. 18. Thus he became the purchaſer of righteouſnes for us, <hi>and is made of God Righteouſnes to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. But all this he did not by the rule of the Law or Covenant of works, but of the ſecret and ſacred Covenant made between the Father and him: Therefore having mentioned the voluntarines of his ſuffering in the fore quoted <hi>Joh,</hi> 10. 18. He addeth, <hi>This Commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> implying that this his ſatisfactory obedience in dying for us had its regulating not by the old Covenant of works, or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Law given to man, but by the Covenant which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the Father and the Son in reference to man, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall poſitive Commandment from the Father agreeing with the tenor of that Covenant. As for our apprehending and pleading the righteouſnes of Chriſt to Juſtification, impudency it ſelf will neither affirm it to be done by the rule of the Covenant of law and works; nor deny it to be done in Conformity to the Covenant of grace and rule of the Goſpel. Or becauſe Chriſt hath born the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Lawes breach, ſhall he therefore be Called our legall righteouſnes, as from the <hi>formall reaſon of the thing?</hi> Nay both that Chriſt ſuffered, and the Father received and accepted his ſufferings in full ſatisfaction for our tranſgreſſions; That the Father ſent him to ſatisfie the juſtice of his law for us; and for his ſatisfactions ſake, he doth no more impute to us the breach of his Law; All this is the fruit of his grace and in conformity to the Goſpel and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; not to the Law and Covenant of works. Therefore if we give the denomination from the formall reaſon of the thing,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:167891:94"/> we muſt call it our Evangelicall not Legall righteouſnes which is in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Touching the other oppoſite term, that any thing inherent in man, whether the gifts of grace, Faith, Repentance, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or their fruits and works, ſhould be called our Goſpel righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; I ſee no reaſon for it, neither can deviſe in what other ſenſe they may be ſo called, but by a Catachreſticall Ironia which names a thing and means the contrary.

                           <hi>The righteouſneſſe of the New Covenant then being the performance of its conditions;</hi> this is his firſt Concluſion, which by the word (then) bearing the force of (therefore) he would inſinuate to lean upon ſome foregoing premiſſes, when contrariwiſe, there is not ſo much as a peble of four grains to ſuſtein it, not a word laid as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof.

                           <hi>And its conditions being our obeying the Goſpel or believing.</hi> This is his ſecond Concluſion, taken as granted, when contrariwiſe his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers utterly deny it.

And let the world judg whether he ſhew himſelf a Chriſtian Teacher or an Antichriſtian Impoſter, who having promiſed a confirmation of his ſtrange and before unheard of doctrine, brings nothing but flouriſhes of words to charm fools, not one argument or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſatisfie the wiſe and conſcientious.

                        <p>
                           <hi>To affirm therefore that our Evangelicall or New Covenant Righteouſnes is in Chriſt and not in our ſelves, or performed by Chriſt and not by our ſelves, is ſuch a monſtrous piece of Antinomian Doctrine that no man</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid to his Reader, if upon the bare authority of my words (when I have no one good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove them) thou wilt not become a rank Papiſt; I will regiſter thee for an Antinomian, and make thee out to the world ſuch a Monſter that all ſhall abhor thee as unſufferable. With this Thunder-bolt he knows he ſhall ſhake into an <hi>Ague</hi> all thoſe that <hi>Nicodemus</hi>-like are Diſciples of Chriſt, but ſecretly for fear of the Jewes.

                        <p>But he is not forth with an <hi>Antinomian</hi> whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo termeth. If <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his tranſmigration of ſouls into new bodies were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, I ſhould conclude that the ghoſt of one of thoſe ghoſtly

                        <p>Yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> finding himſelf bound by promiſe to prove many things (as was ſaid before) that his fallacious dealing might not be too notorious and ſhamefull, he chooſeth one of the many (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt untouched) to ſpeak <hi>ſomething to it,</hi> (as he had ſaid) though not to prove it. And in that which he ſaith, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to confirm his own aſſertion, but a meer reviling abuſing &amp; abaſing of them that aſſert the contrary, under the falſe imputation of <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi> And here he comes upon the ſtage like <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> who in a Phrenſie taking his Wife and Children to be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs and her Whelps, falls upon them fiercly with his Clubb and

At the ſuppoſition of ſuch aſſertions, (which none ever laid down in theſe terms) the man is in a rage, beats the wind, and flings duſt in the Aire, cryeth <hi>Blaſphemy, hereſie, impiety,</hi> and enumerates <hi>Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities upon abſurdities</hi> ariſing from ſuch doctrine, all which I am not at leizure to tranſcribe, (it being all ſuperfluous and not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) but may be read at large <hi>pag.</hi> 111, 112, 113, of his Tractate.

                        <p>Firſt then as we deny not Faith in the Lord Chriſt, to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to apprehend to our ſelves Chriſt for our juſtification, and a declarative evidence to our own ſouls that we are actually juſtified by him; (as before hath been granted) ſo we affirm it to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and popiſh doctrine which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth here <hi>pag.</hi> 111 deliver, in aſſerting repentance, obedience, ſubmiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterward all other vertues and good works, to be conditions of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> by which as by our Goſpel righteouſnes we are, and without which preceding, we cannot be juſtified.

                        <p n="2">2 We affirm Repentance, Obedience, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all good works which the Goſpel requireth, to be originally and materially the works and duties of the Law. Nature and naturall conſcience it ſelf ſuggeſting to every of us both the reſt, and withall in caſe of offence committed againſt God or man, to repent of it, to ſorrow for it, and at our utmoſt to make ſatisfaction for the offence. Yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Faith in Chriſt, is in generall required by the Old Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. We in no wiſe aſcribe to the Goſpel a creating of new points of righteouſnes, or injoining of new duties which the Law did not at leaſt in generall bind us unto, (this opinion we leave as proper and peculiar to the <hi>Socinians</hi>) But a modification ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing and appropriating the righteouſneſs and duties which the Law in generall commanded, to the now preſent lapſed condition
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:167891:97"/> of man, to Gods preſent offers of grace, and our preſent neceſſities. Yea herein we have Mr. B. conſenting to us, who, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 30. and its Explication delivers his judgment herein to be fully one with the ſtream of Orthodox Divines. So that if we ſhould affirm that Chriſt hath beleeved, repented, ſorrowed, &amp;c. for us and in our ſteed: it would not thence follow, that we pronounce Chriſt to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the conditions of the New but onely of the Old Covenant for us.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Yet are we far from affirming that Chriſt in the moſt ſtrict and proper ſenſe hath ſo beleeved, repented, &amp;c. for us, that we ſhould be taken to have beleeved, repented, &amp;c. not in our ſelves but in him and by him. But the reaſon why we neither affirm nor hold it, is not becauſe that theſe are our Goſpel righteouſnes or New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conditions of righteouſneſs and life in the ſenſe before oft mentioned, for we have denyed and do ſtill deny them to be ſuch: But 1 becauſe it is in queſtion whether the active righteouſnes of Chriſt be imputable to us for juſtification; And 2 if it were, yet were it an unchriſting of Chriſt to affirm him to have been ever in ſuch a ſtate and condition, that he had need of repentance or faith to the remiſſion of ſins. He took indeed our nature not the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our nature; had our ſin imputed to him, or (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe expreſly ſpeaketh) laid on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. to ſuffer and ſatisfie for it: but had no ſin of his own to repent of and mortifie, then had there not been vertue in his Prieſthood &amp; ſacrifice to have expiated ours. And to ſay that he actually repented, ſorrowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, &amp;c. for the pardon of our ſins, we confes is a harſh, unproper and Catachreſticall locution. Yet we ſtill hold that the flawes and infirmities of our faith and repentance as well as our other iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were laid upon Chriſt, that he hath ſatisfied divine juſtice for them by his ſufferings; and that therefore God imputeth them not to us being once in Chriſt. Otherwiſe though they are parts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel righteouſnes to ſanctification, the ſin and infirmity that is in them, in not ſquaring fully with the Law their rule, would bring upon us condemnation.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things premiſſed, all the abſurdities which (to make the aſſertion odious) Mr. B. layeth upon us for affirming our New Covenant righteouſnes to be in Chriſt in the ſenſe mentioned and explained, and denying our faith, repentance, obedience, &amp;c. to be our New Covenant righteouſneſſe to Juſtification; vaniſh into ſmoke.

                        <p n="2">2 Nor doth it <hi>imply that Jewes, Pagans, and every one ſhall be ſaved,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath fulfilled the conditions of both Covenants for them, ſo that they are culpable in neither.

But I have before proved faith to be needfull to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, to bring home into our own Conſciences the benefit and evidence of our Juſtification, even Faith acting in us, therefore Faith ſo acting in us is alſo needful to this as well as to other uſes, though Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the infirmity of it in reference to the Law.</p>

                        <p>Here now wee finde Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> returning from his irefull purſuit of his imaginary, not reall <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and of a dead mans Ghoſt that could neither ſee nor hear him. And when hee reviews what he had written, hee ſees it neither holpen nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his hot words ſpent upon the wind. He had affirmed, that there is a two-fold Righteouſneſſe neceſſary to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; one, the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to us, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perſonall Righteouſneſſe, or Righteouſneſſe of our owne, inherent in our ſelves: And to this our own Righteouſneſſe had attributed an equall power with the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to our Juſtification, if not a power above, and ſuperiour to it. This aſſertion of his he perceives to ſavour ſo much of humane arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and (to uſe his own words) to be a ſelf-exalting, horrid Doctrine, of ſo high a nature, and ſo contradictory to the whole Tenor of the Goſpel, that a ſhort affected brawl with No-bodies, and dead men, cannot turn away the hatred which all that know and love the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt needs conceive againſt it. Hee is therefore in a ſtreight, cure it he cannot, revoke it he will not: Therefore in ſtead of a better ſhift, he poſteth to the Monks &amp; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, &amp; borrows their either, Cowl, or Cloak, to cover the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it. And good reaſon have they to ſtead him, for it is their cauſe in his hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification by our own perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that hath ſtreightened him.

                        <p>We find in Scripture, that as Chriſt hath his <hi>Mystery,</hi> ſo hath Antichriſt his <hi>Myſtery</hi> alſo: And that this latter is a <hi>Myſtery of

But it will not hold, therefore is he forced ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to make uſe of the proper ſlime which the former Builders have left for them that come after to repair; ſo doth hee in this place. None of his own ſHifts and tricks could hide the menſtruouſneſs, and monſtrouſneſs of his Doctrine; this Pall from <hi>Rome</hi> doth it no leſs perfectly then the Fig-leaf Aprons covered the nakedneſs and filthineſs of our firſt Progenitors from the eye of God.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:167891:100"/> as he ſpeaketh, wee are agreed) but about their office and end to which they are to be performed; whether theſe duties are conditions of our Juſtification, and that the end of our perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ought to be, that we may be juſtified by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which conſiſteth in their performance? Doth hee meane to tune up a <hi>Palinodiam,</hi> to recant and eat up his former aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he doth here ſo lenifie the roughneſs, and correct the extravagancy both of his words and matter before delivered? Nothing leſs, but hee throws ſugar after his poyſon, both that it may goe down the more quietly what he hath given already to his unwary Readers to drink, and that they may be ready with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpition to drink deeper, and more deadly draughts of the ſame poyſon, which thorow the whole ſequele of this his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe he makes his buſineſs to temper for them. I ſhall there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer more fully where he ſpeakes more fully. In the mean time all may ſee his dealing here to be not faire and logicall, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious and ſophiſtical.</p>
                        <p>He tels us in the concluſion of his Explication, that <hi>He will not digreſs from his intended ſubject ſo far, as to enter here into a diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature and workings of that Grace which doth enable us to perform theſe conditions, but refers us to</hi> Parkers <hi>Theſes de traducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one peccatoris ad vitam.</hi>

                        <p>What that Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> or his work is, I know not. But that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not here deliver his own judgement, I think he doth well. For if his judgement in the doctrine of Gods Grace work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto mans converſion, and ſanctification, be not more ſound then about the operation of the ſame Grace to mans Juſtification, his ſilence will be farre more acceptable then his beſt argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to chaſte ears, and ſpiritual minds. And little cauſe have we to expect any good from him upon that ſubject, becauſe that although there are many who extoll the power of mans Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to his converſion, even to the clouding of the glory of Grace, that do notwithſtanding hold faſt the doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt alone, without any intermixture of our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: Yet I know no one ſort or ſect of men that part our Juſtification between Gods righteouſneſs imputed, and our own inherent, but that the ſame alſo, about the doctrine of Free-will, are wholly Popiſh, if not Pelagian alſo.</p>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>That men are ſometimes called Righteous in reference to the Lawes and judgements of men, I acknowledge: Alſo in regard of ſome of their particular actions, which are for the ſubſtance good; and perhaps ſometimes in a comparative ſenſe, as they are compared with the ungodly: as a line leſſe crooked, ſhould be called ſtreight in compariſon of one more crooked. But how improper an expreſſion that is, you may eaſily perceive. The ordinary phraſe of Scripture hath more
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:167891:101"/> truth and aptitude then ſo. Therefore it muſt needs be, that men are called righteous, in reference to the New Covenant onely. Which is plain thus, Righteouſneſſe is but the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our actions or perſons as they relate to ſome rule. This Rule, when it is the law of Man, and our actions ſuit thereto, we are then righteous before men. When this rule is Gods Law, it is either that of Workes, or that of Grace. In relation to the former there is none Righteous, no not one; for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. Onely in Christ who hath obeyed and ſatisfied, wee are Righteous. But if you conſider our actions and perſons in relation to the Rule of the New Covenant, ſo all the regenerate are perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous: becauſe they all performe the conditions of this Covenant, and are properly pronounced righteous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Neither can it be conceived how the works of beleivers ſhould either pleaſe God, or be called righteouſneſſe, as they relate to that old Rule, which doth pronounce them unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hatefull and accurſed.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
                           <p>All this (in its ſubſtance at leaſt) might be granted to a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious man, that meaneth as he ſpeaketh, hating all equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mentall reſervations. For it being firſt granted to us (what is here granted) That men are called in Scripture, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſometimes in <hi>Regard of their imputed Righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>in reference to the lawes and judgements of Men,</hi> ſometimes alſo <hi>in regard of ſome of their particular actions, which are for their ſubſtance good:</hi> and ſometimes <hi>in a comparative ſenſe, as they are compared with the ungodly:</hi> The 3 laſt of theſe conſiſting in the Conformity of perſons and actions with the Lawes of God, or of men, though not a perfect Conformity: upon this firſt yeelded to us, we could without any prejudice to truth grant back again to ſuch qualified men as are before mentioned, that ſometimes men are called [perſonally] <hi>Righteous, in reference to the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> i. e. in regard of their inchoat <hi>ſanctification,</hi> and an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe flown out of Chriſt into them, by means of their union unto Chriſt; for which (though not yet Complete and perfect in them,) they are, <hi>à parte praeſtantiore,</hi> termed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                           <p>But to Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> whom we have as the wolfe by the ears, prepared if we hold him, to bite at our hands, if we let him go,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:167891:102"/> to fall upon our throats, or invade our face and head; if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him what he would have, to bite at us; if we grant it him, to improve it againſt Chriſt our head; we grant nothing, wee can grant nothing, becauſe in all that he ſpeaketh, he means not as he ſpeaketh, but covers under fine words fallacies and falſities.</p>
                           <p>Firſt then, we except againſt his Theſis, that it is a meer fardle of Amphibologies and Equivocations. That he ſo delivers all, that he will be held to nothing. For firſt, when he ſaith <hi>In this fore-explained ſenſe it is,</hi> his meaning was (no doubt) to leave us doubtfull, or at leaſt to leave himſelfe this advantage, that wee ſhould remain uncertain where to find him. If we ſhould fetch the explanation from the next Theſes, he might except that his meaning was of ſome of the more remote Theſes; if from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, he would fly to the next; or if wee ſhould draw the ſenſe from both the next and remote Theſes, he might evade thus, that he meant not any thing that was ſaid in any of his Theſes, but ſomething in the explication of ſome of them. And thus wee might purſue the wild-gooſe long enough, before wee ſhould finde her pitching.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, When he ſaith, <hi>Men in Scriptures are ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally righteous,</hi> his purpoſe was to leave us in the like doubt, whether he means the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of juſtification,</hi> or the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Sanctification;</hi> and himſelfe the like advantage to fly from the one to the other, as may moſt further his ends.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, when he ſaith again, <hi>And in this ſenſe it is,</hi> he leaves us as knowing as before, what ſenſe he meaneth, himſelfe hath not yet concluded what the ſenſe ſhall be, ſaving in general, ſuch a ſenſe as upon all occaſions may ſerve to his purpoſes.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, When he ſaith, <hi>That the faith and duties of believers are ſaid to pleaſe God.</hi> viz. <hi>As they are related to the Covenant of Grace, and not as they are meaſured by the Covenant of works;</hi> he had a project to leave us uncertain, whether by the word <hi>They</hi> and <hi>They</hi> twice uſed, he means <hi>thoſe beleevers,</hi> or <hi>thoſe duties and works.</hi> And upon this hinge runs the queſtion in great part between us and the Papiſts, whether the works make the perſon, or the new relation of the perſon make his works accepted.</p>
                           <p>And in the Fift place no leſſe ambiguity is there in the phraſe, Related to the Covenant of Grace, not to the Covenant of works. For in many reſpects may a perſon or thing be related to either Covenant, and he tells us not in what reſpect he meaneth.</p>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:167891:102"/>
                           <p>Now though from the whole ſcope of his worſt we may aſſure our ſelves that he would be underſtood in the worh, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Popiſh ſenſe, in reference to all theſe things which he delivers in ſuch words as may bear a manifold ſenſe: yet becauſe the man delights to dance in the dark that he may not be yet taken, wee will neither croſſe his humor, nor befool our ſelves in dancing after him, untill he ſhall diſcover himſelf and his meaning in the light.</p>
                           <p>To the explication I except, that it is full of extravagancies, equivocations, contradictions, ſaying and gainſaying, doing, and undoing, mentall reſervations, and in all of fallacious ſubtilties. Firſt he racks &amp; rakes together Scriptures in heaps to prove that a mans eyes are in his head, not in his heeles; I mean, to confirm that which no rational man ever denyed, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſometimes men are called righteous by reaſon of a perſonal righteouſneſſe &amp;c. what an extravagancy is this, ſo ſtrongly to fortifie, where there is no fear of an aſſault? But there lurketh here a twofold fallaciouſneſſe and ſubtilty of Maſter <hi>Baxter.</hi> 1 a trick to delude his inconſiderate readers that view his words running, without any ſtay or ſtopping to conſider with an opinion that he hath all the Old and New Teſtaments on his ſide, in that hee can ſpit Scriptures ſo ſwiftly and numerouſly for himſelfe. 2. a feat to ſcrew into the mindes of unwary men a conceit, that all theſe Scriptures, (which he confides they will not examine) doe hold forth juſtification by our own perſonal, or inherent righteouſneſs. Which they do no more prove, then a crow upon a ſheeps back proves the ſheep to be a crow, or a red hat forced upon Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> head proves him to be a Cardinal: Yet this muſt hee mean and aim at, elſe (to uſe the very ſame words which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed againſt Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh</hi>) his Argumentation is no more to the buſineſſe that he hath in hand, then a harp to a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For it is not the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification, but of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification that is the ſubject of his diſpute.</p>
                           <p>2. He is liberal in his conceſſions, grants us firſt that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls men righteous ſometimes in regard <hi>of their imputed righteouſneſſe;</hi> and when they are ſo called in reſpect of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſſe, it is ſometimes in <hi>reference to the lawes and judgements of men;</hi> Alſo [ſometimes] in regard of <hi>ſome of their particular actions which are in their ſubſtance good:</hi> (viz. therein conformed to the law.) And ſometimes in a <hi>comparative ſenſe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:167891:103"/> as they are compared with the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> Yet with one flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction recalls all again, thus, <hi>Therefore it muſt needs be that men muſt be called Righteous in reference to the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant onely.</hi> Who ever heard untill now of ſuch a concluſion from ſuch premiſſes. If becauſe we are ſometimes in Scripture called righteous in regard of imputed Righteouſneſſe, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> Divinity) is our legal righteouſneſſe, and in regard of theſe other waies which he mentioneth, none of which relateth to the New Covenant, how doth it follow hence, <hi>Ergo,</hi> men are called righteous in reference to the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant onely? In this, his Logick is no leſſe myſtical then his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. I can ſee no other ground of ſuch an argutation in ſtead of an Argumentation, But this; Maſter <hi>Baxer</hi> hath granted, and laid the premiſſes, <hi>Ergo, earum contrarium verum eſt, i. e.</hi> Therefore the contrary to what he ſaith muſt needs be true. But paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he drawes the concluſion not from thoſe conceſſions; but onely from the words next &amp; immediately going before, viz. <hi>The ordinary phraſe of Scripture hath more truth and aptitude then ſo, Therefore</hi> &amp;c. Did he not grant that the Scriptures do call men righteous in all the former mencioned reſpects? what is it then that he here ſaith <hi>The ordinary phraſe of Scripture hath more truth &amp;c.</hi> Are ſome Scriptures more true then others? And therefore doth he reject that which is affirmed by the leſſe true, &amp; conclude that which is affirmed by the more true Scriptures? or can hee deny the Scriptures ſometimes to call men righteous in the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects? No marvell if he doth ſo prophanely wreſt and abuſe the Scriptures, when he takes them for ſuch falſe and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed things, that in his account they need alſo an inherent truth and righteouſneſſe to juſtifie them.</p>
                           <p>I ſhould here prove, that men are called <hi>Righteous, not in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the New Covenant onely.</hi> But let him firſt bring his proofs to confirm the contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is plain thus (ſaith he;)</p>

                           <p>He had before ſaid in the Explication of <hi>Theſ.</hi> 16. pag. 96. <hi>That Righteouſneſs is no proper real being, but a Modificatio entis,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of a being. This he means alſo here in calling it the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination</hi> of our perſons and actions as related to ſome Rule. But what end hee hath in degrading Righteouſneſs from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a poſitive reall being more then other virtues, I do but yet kenn at a diſtance, and not fully comprehend. This wee clearly ſee that he takes the chair, and challengeth to himſelf a Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power to create and deſtroy what his Cap thinks fit in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Logick, and Divinity.

Such is the animoſity of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> where his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions agree not with the rules of Philoſophy, or Divinity, there he damns and annihilates the old, and with the breath of his mouth creates a new Philoſophy, and Divinity, that ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his opinions, and ſo God-like,</p>

                           <p>In the ſame manner the choiceſt of all the learned and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divines that I have met with, make Righteouſneſs thus taken in its largeſt ſenſe, to ſound, and to bee one and the ſame thing with virtue it ſelf. Some call it <hi>bonitatem, probitatem, &amp; integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> goodneſſe, honeſty, and integrity; others, <hi>rectitudinem virtutis,</hi> the uprightneſſe, or rectitude of Virtue, defining its ſpecials by Virtue, when they aſſign the next and immediate <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> by <hi>habitus,</hi> when they aſſign the remote <hi>genus.</hi> And are not Virtues, and either naturall, morall, or infuſed Habits, Poſitive, and Reall Beings?

                           <p>Nevertheleſſe though we deny to him that Righteouſneſſe is but a bare <hi>Denomination,</hi> or dead notion; yet we grant to him that true righteouſneſs both of Mens Actions and perſons muſt relate to ſome rule. What will follow hence?</p>

                           <p>This, and that which followeth is all ſophiſticall, fallacious, and catching.</p>
                           <p>Firſt the diſtinction which he here maketh of the Law of God, that it is either the Law of Works, or Law of Grace, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a ſtrange phraſe to chaſte ears, that deſire to hear Scripture Doctrines delivered in Scripture termes, that oppoſe Grace to the Law, and are not wont to call it a Law.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is contrary to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrine and Goſpel: for howſoever he in words talketh of a two-fold Covenant of Works and of Grace, to beguile ſuch as deſire to be beguiled; yet really hee labours to bring all under a Covenant of Works, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mans own righteouſneſſe the condition of both, ſo altering the name, but retaining the nature and power of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtill; as I have before evinced from his diſputes, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will in the following part of his book diſcover more fully.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. There is an ambiguity in the word <hi>Rule,</hi> he manifeſteth not how farre his meaning therein in reference to the Law extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether for a direction onely what is good, and what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, wherewith God will be ſerved, and what is it that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth him, teaching us to perform the one, and to ſhun the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Or whether alſo for a direction how far, &amp; in what degrees the good is to be done, and the evill ſhunned, that we may bee juſtified and ſaved thereby. Though we may without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſmell his meaning herein, yet becauſe he reſerveth it for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place clearly to expreſſe himſelfe, we alſo will reſerve it for the ſame place to make him a full anſwer.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. He playeth his uſuall game of equivocation, in telling us, that <hi>In relation to the former there is none righteous, no not one.</hi> This is not that which is concluded, and nothing ought to be in the concluſion, which is not alſo in the premiſes. The concluſion (as we have ſeen) is that none is <hi>called</hi> righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The proof here is, that none <hi>is</hi> righteous. Theſe phraſes much differ. A man may be called righteous, in reference to the rule of the Law, though he be not abſolutely righteous, in every particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Juſtification; and himſelf acknowledgeth that in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Scripture calleth men righteous, in reference to the Law of Works, who notwithſtanding ſhall never be juſtified by the Law of Works; as a little before in this <hi>Explication</hi> we have ſeen. <hi>Concerning the Righteouſneſſe which is by the Law, I was blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.

Phi. 3. 9. yet both ſuch as gave them the denomination of <hi>Righteous men,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf will not ſay, that theſe were the righteouſneſs of the New Covenant: I could heap, and hoard up Scriptures to the ſame purpoſe which call men righteous in reference to the Law of Works: But in what reſpects men are called ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for an unperfect righteouſneſs is not the thing in queſtion. Not that they were juſtified by it, is certain; but in whatſoever other reſpects, it deſtroyeth Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> concluſion, that men are called Righteous in relation to the Covenant of Grace <hi>onely;</hi> and ſhews the inconſequence of his Argumentation, that becauſe none is perfectly righteous, <hi>viz.</hi> to Juſtification in relation to the Law of Works, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in no other reſpect is he <hi>called</hi> Righteous according to the Covenant of Works.</p>
                           <p>What he addeth, <hi>Onely in Chriſt, who hath obeyed, and ſatisfied, we are Righteous.</hi> This we embrace as our Goſpel <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alone without company, or ſuffrage of Prophet, or Apoſtle, Ancient, or Modern Writers, affirms to be our legall Righteouſneſs. But hitherto we finde it an affirmation without confirmation. It follows.</p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Bax.</hi> But if you conſider our actions and perſons in relation to the Rule of the New Covenant, ſo all the Regenerate are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally righteous, becauſe they all perform the conditions of this Covenant, and are properly pronounced Righteous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Neither can it be conceived how the works of Beleevers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:167891:105"/> ſhould either pleaſe God, or be called Righteouſneſs, as they relate to that old Rule, which doth pronounce them unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hatefull, and accurſed.</q>
                           <p>He proceeds ſtill in his ſophiſtry without any the leaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Scripture, or any thing elſe, ſave the wind of wit and words to prove what he would have us to beleeve. It behoveth him that will faſten and ſcrew into the judgements of men new, and ſtrange Doctrines, that never ſounded before (at leaſt in the ſame phraſe of words) in their ears, to bring irrefragable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm it. But ſuch paradoxes and prodigies both of doctrines and words, doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here hold forth, as were never before heard of, but in uttering them he is a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to us, and we <hi>Barbarians</hi> to him, in not underſtanding them, yet brings nothing elſe but his own word to promote them. The myſteries of his ſophiſtry are ſo deep, that our woodden wits cannot ſink to the bottome to comprehend and underſtand it.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, what means he by the Rule of the New Covenant? Doth he put the New Covenant here in the Paſſive, or in the Active, and Poſſeſſive ſenſe? <hi>i. e.</hi> Doth hee meane by the Rule of the New Covenant a rule extrinſecall, and without the New Covenant, to which the New Covenant muſt bee conformed, that it may bee regular; or a rule in the New Covenant, and by it made out to us, whereunto wee muſt bee conformed? If in this latter ſenſe, then whether without, or elſe with reference to ſome end? if to ſome end, whether then to Sanctification or Juſtification? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as conjecture that he puts the phraſe in the firſt ſenſe, that he tels us here of a Rule to which the New Covenant muſt be conformed, becauſe it is altogether alien from the ſcope of his diſpute; and beſides how we ſhould be related to a rule with which the New Covenant muſt ſuit, I cannot ſee; for ſuch a Rule I ſhould conceive to be immanent in God, and ſo hid from us, that we cannot perceive how to regulate our ſelves by it. This then he cannot mean.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Neither doe I conceive that his meaning is, that we are to be conformed to the Rule which is contained in, and manifeſted by the New Covenant, without reſpect to any end to which the rule directeth; that we ought to be thus and thus qualified, and thus to act onely, becauſe the Goſpel ſo biddeth, without refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the end of ſuch qualifications and actings: For neither
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:167891:106"/> is this any thing to the purpoſe of his diſpute. Neither in this ſenſe can ſuch qualifications and actings be in any ſhew of reaſon called, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here calleth them, <hi>Conditions of the New Covenant:</hi> For they are Conditions (if at all Conditions) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome ends, without which the end cannot be obtained. Or what ends doth the New Covenant immediately point at, more then either our Juſtification or Sanctification?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. If he mean the Rule of the New Covenant for Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. Then I ſhall demand of him, whether the Law of Works be not the rule of the matter and ſubſtance of thoſe qualifications and actions which conduce to Sanctification, even under the New Covenant; and whether the Rule of the New Covenant or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doe extend any further then to the Modification of thoſe Qualifications and Actions, directing to the Mediator from whom to derive thoſe Qualifications and Actions, and by, and through whom to preſent our ſelves and them unto God? 2. And then, whether in reference to Sanctification, men may not be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Righteous, as having their righteouſneſs relating to the rule of the Old, as well as the New Covenant? I cannot be ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to think that Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> having poſitively affirmed that beleevers are in part under the Curſe of the Law, will deny them to be alſo in part under the rule and direction of the Law; if he ſhould, hee muſt brand upon himſelf the due infamy of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm, which he unduly and falſly chargeth upon others. 3. And yet this will in no wiſe advantage his cauſe: For we grant him, that in reference to the inherent righteouſnes of Sanctification, men are called Righteous in the Scriptures by a perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. But what is this to that righteouſneſſe in our ſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary to the righteouſnes which is in Chriſt, to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which he had in the former Theſes aſſerted, and here goes about to prove or illuſtrate?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. If he mean the rule of the New Covenant to Juſtification, (which ſeems to me unqueſtionable, though hee will not fully expreſs himſelf) then</p>
                           <p>1. I demand of him, how our actions relate to this rule? Is it, that themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> our very actions may be juſtified by it? This he condemneth, <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 25, and its Explication. Or that they may Juſtifie us, as conditions of our Juſtification? This moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is his meaning, which when he confeſſeth, he confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worſe then Popiſh; for the Papiſts aſcribe Juſtification not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:167891:106"/> to actions indefinitely, but to ſome good works onely. When he ſpeaks more broadly then they, let him ſhew himſelf without a vizard under the name and notion of a Papiſt, and he will not want anſwerers or anſwers.</p>
                           <p>But upon this ſuppoſition let us ſee what he inferreth; <hi>So all the regenerate are perſonally righteous, becauſe they all performe the conditions of this Covenant, and are properly pronounced righteous thereby.</hi> Let us now collect together what in probability is the whole ſumme of his diſpute. Leaving what he hath ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that men are called Righteous in reſpect of Juſtification, by the rule of the Law, becauſe wee doe not, cannot perform the conditions of the Law (unto which I have already anſwered) here he endeavours to prove, that they are called Righteous onely in reference to the rule of the Goſpel; and if we draw his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a ſyllogiſm, it runs thus.</p>
                           <p>All that perform the conditions which the Goſpel, or New Covenant preſcribe unto Juſtification, are perſonally righteous thereby, and properly ſo called.</p>
                           <p>But all the Regenerate perform the conditions which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or New Covenant preſcribe unto Juſtification.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ergo,</hi> All the Regenerate are perſonally righteous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called thereby.</p>
                           <p>If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith not this, either he ſaith nothing, or I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing of what he ſaith. But if this be his meaning, then as to his Propoſition or <hi>Major,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>1. I except againſt the ambiguity of the termes, they want explication. What he means by conditions, I know not; for if wee grant one, yet ſhall wee grant but one Goſpel condition of Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. When therefore he puts the plural number for the ſingular, untill he ſhall certifie us what he meaneth, we muſt leave him uncerta in what wee will anſwer. Again, it is doubtful what he meaneth by <hi>perſonally Righteous:</hi> if he mean thereby the ſame thing with that which our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call <hi>inherently Righteous,</hi> and put in oppoſition to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſſe, we deny the propoſition as falſe and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh. But if he means by perſonal righteouſneſſe the Juſtification of our perſons by the blood of Chriſt apprehended by Faith, we gainſay not his propoſition, but pronounce it to be utterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his purpoſe, which is to prove a twofold righteouſneſs, one in our ſelves, the other in Chriſt neceſſary to ſalvation. Yet
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:167891:107"/> that this is not, but the former is his meaning, he makes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the word [<hi>thereby] i. e.</hi> by ſuch performance. And if righteous by his owne workes and performance, hee needs not to ſtep further to Chriſt for another righteouſneſs, to make him more then righteous, exorbitantly righteous, righteous in a way of ſupererogation. He that hath juſtified himſelf, needs no other Juſtifier. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the Aſſumption, or <hi>miner</hi> Propoſition, I except that it labours of the ſame ambiguity in the word [<hi>conditions</hi>] with the <hi>major,</hi> ſo that untill hee tell us how many thouſand, and what conditions he meaneth, I muſt be dumb inſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>To both Propoſitions, I except that there lyeth a fallacie in the word [<hi>perform.</hi>] No living perſon can <hi>perform</hi> any thing ſo as to be juſtified, and bee termed abſolutely righteous by ſuch performing. Yet every Regenerate man doth <hi>perform</hi> that upon which he may reſt confident that Chriſt is made of God Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to him, and ſo have his Juſtification evidenced to his own conſcience. But if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will change his termes, and call (after the tone of Scriptures, and Orthodox Writers) Chriſt our New Covenant or New Goſpel righteouſneſs, and our <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formings</hi> or works, our legall righteouſneſs, then lo how neare I ſhall cloſe with him. I ſhall ſay with him, that all which <hi>perform,</hi> are righteous; but in what ſenſe? Righteous in a proportion anſwering the proportion of their performings; if they perform perfectly, then perfectly righteous; if unperfectly, and ſinfully, then ſinfully, and unperfec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ly righteous. Whatſoever elſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would hence elicite, in doing it hee proſtitutes all his integrity to ſophiſtry and fallacies. The reſt hath been ſaid, and anſwered before, in, and upon the former clauſes of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                           <p>Yet as if he had ſpoken all this out of <hi>Peters</hi> chair, which is as free from errors as an Iriſh cabbin from Lice, ſo he holds forth his golden foot triumphantly to tread on their necks, as being all laid proſtrate before him, whoſoever have ſince the beginning of the world, ſaid any thing contrary to this doctrine which he hath brought to light now at the end of the world.

We doe not place Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in ſome outſide conformity of the utter man, and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible works <hi>onely</hi> to the Letter of the Law, but in the actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Holyneſſe and Righteouſneſſe of the Law into mans heart, working a reall change of the whole man from the image of Satan, unto the image of God. Whom the Lord Jeſus hath juſtified, and by his blood reconciled to God, ſo changing their relations: Them alſo he ſanctifieth by his Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes to the image of God by the alteration of their qualities, which though it be but inchoate and unperfect at the firſt, yet is it more and more conſummate and perfited untill the day of the Lord Chriſt. So that here is not <hi>onely</hi> the Law without, to rule and direct, but the holyneſſe and righteouſneſs of the Law, and Chriſt by his Spirit as the root thereof, wrought by Goſpel grace in the heart, and diffuſed through the whole life; and the ſame conformed not onely to the Law, but the Goſpel alſo, as before hath been mentioned. In reſpect of this ſanctification, though yet but unperfect, wee indeed affirme the godly to bee ſometimes called Righteous, yet not righteous to Juſtification, but in regard of the life of Righteouſneſſe new begotten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them.</p>
                           <p>But it is obſervable how ſubtlely he ſlanders the Orthodox Teachers, with a fault which is his, not theirs, how hee would condemn them for men, attributing too much to the Law and Workes, becauſe they call thoſe virtues, and good works which the Law commandeth, a righteouſneſſe with which the godly do ſerve the Lord, in, and through Chriſt Jeſus.

If you ask how ſuch workes ſhould juſtifie, being ſo unrighteous and accurſed? yes, ſaith he, as God hath appointed them to be the conditions of the New Covenant, the performance whereof juſtifieth and maketh us perſonally righteous before God. Here now is a heavenly Goſpel. Such conditions and ſuch a juſtification, if the one bee accurſed much more the other. And where is Gods Righteouſneſs, if hee will not juſtifie but upon accurſed conditions?</p>
                           <p>Thoſe that will not, have not conſented to this doctrine of his, he calls <hi>intolerably ignorant.</hi> Let him now name any one either Divine, or underſtanding Chriſtian in any of the Churches that have ſhook off Popery, and not ſuckt it back again, conſenting with him in this doctrine; elſe it is not his humility that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in calling all the godly and learned that are, or have been in any of the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>intolerably ignorant.

                           <p>What he talks of the <hi>ſtreight, crooked line,</hi> hath its dependence onely upon the fallacious definition which hee before gave of Righteouſneſs, making it a mear empty notion, not a vertue or gif of Gods grace; which definition falling, this compariſon fals with it. For if we grant unto Righteouſneſs a real being, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf will not deny but, as one ſparke of fire under a vaſt heap of aſhes is as true and real fire as if no aſhes were there; ſo one ſpark of righteouſneſs, (I mean living Righteouſneſs) under a whole body of infirmities, is as true and truly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as if no infirmities were there; And if God vouchſafe to call a man righteous in reference to that poor pittance of Righteouſneſs, rather than unrighteous for the whole maſs of his corruptions: <hi>what art thou O man that replieſt againſt God? is thine eye evil becauſe he is good?</hi>

                                 <hi>Anſw.</hi> Holineſſe ſignifieth no more but a dedication to God, either by ſeparation onely, or by qualifying the ſubject, firſt with an aptitude to its Divine employment, and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating, or devoting it: as in our ſanctification. Now a perſon imperfectly ſo qualified, is yet truly and really ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. And therefore may truly be called Holy ſo farre.

                           <p>The words of the Poet are here verified by Maſter <hi>Baxter, mali bonos malos eſſe volunt, ut ſint ſui ſimiles.</hi> Hee is angry with the ſimplicity of the godly and orthodox that they are ſingle and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in their diſputes, and would have them double and crafty like himſelfe. In this ſenſe I acknowledge the Argument which he ſaith they bring, and is moſt they ſay to maintain their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſimple objection. They have more to ſay for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thereof then all his ſophiſtry can ſubvert. And this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument though ſimple, yet is not ſilly or weak, but ſtrong and ſound againſt all his batteries. It is drawn <hi>à pari.</hi> If there be a parity between righteouſneſſe and holineſſe to give a denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy and righteous perſons, then the argument is firme, and men may be as properly termed Righteous in reference to a righteousneſſe not yet perfected, as holy in reference to a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not perfected: <hi>at verum prius, ergo &amp; Poſtorius.</hi> The former is true, therefore the latter alſo. Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> denyeth the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and goes about to ſhew a diſparity in this caſe between righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: making holineſſe to be either one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſeparation of a thing or perſon to holy uſe, without an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a new qualification to fit him for holy employment, or at leaſt the qualification of ſuch a perſon firſt alway, and then a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of him afterward, as if uſually the conſecration or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the blood, did not go before the new qualifying of him by the Spirit of Chriſt, (this indeed is not ſo ſquaring with the Popiſh Canon, as his way.) But to let paſſe this, &amp; touch onely upon that wherein he oppoſeth righteouſneſſe to holineſſe. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:167891:109"/> he grants to be a qualification, and conſequently to have a real Being. This here he denyeth, as before, of righteouſneſſe. A meerly fallacious evaſion; for righteouſneſſe hath no leſſe a real being than holineſſe (as hath been before ſhewed.) And the Scripture gives its Teſtimony, making <hi>Righteouſneſſe and true Holineſſe, as it were the two eſſentials of the New Man, which is created after God,</hi> i. e. in anſwer and conformity to <hi>that eſſentiall Righteouſneſſe and Holineſs that are in God himſelfe.</hi> Eph. 4. 24. And what els doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> mean in affirming the Saints to be <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> but by the infuſion or creating of Righteouſneſſe as well as Holineſſe in them, by which they are reformed to the nature of God, which is Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. And no more is it a true Holineſs, than this a true Righteouſneſs which are not both in ſome meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Law of God. And becauſe they are both alike real beings, or qualifications: Therefore what Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith of Holineſs may be no leſſe truly ſaid of Righteouſneſs alſo. That a perſon imperfectly ſo qualified, is yet truly and really ſo qualified, and therefore may truly be called Righteous ſo farre. What he doth <hi>Philoſophari</hi> to the contrary of Righteouſneſs, is againſt both Philoſophy and Divinity, as hath been before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
                           <p>When he hath once opened the perfection of this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to the new rule: we ſhall there and then examine it as in its due time and place.</p>
                           <p>Let him name but one of the heap and multitude of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox writers, that call our Perſonal Righteouſneſs [Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall] in his ſenſe, elſe let him give us leave to conclude, that hee makes no conſcience of heaping together falſities in multitudes to Ecclipſe the truth.

                           <p>In this, and that which followes, there is nothing but dirt and wind, all unworthy of the labour to tranſcribe it, much leſſe deſerving an anſwer to bee given it.

                           <p>Firſt then I undertake to maintaine, that although there be no man upon earth that hath in words pretended more hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Antinomians,</hi> then Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to make them hatefull to ſuch as are fooliſhly apt to hate without a cauſe; yet is there no other man upon earth that hath in reality and ſubſtance ſo much honoured and magnified them as Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> He makes them, even them alone to be the ſound Chriſtians, the advancers and maintainers of the pure Goſpel of Chriſt againſt all the falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and portentous lyes of Antichriſt, rayling againſt them as the onely hinderers of the total ruine of Chriſts Kingdom, and the advancing of the Kingdome of Antichriſt in the roome thereof as Paramount.

How the ſecond thing was before cleared by him, I referre to that which hath been ſaid of both ſides about it. If the caſting of duſt and dirt into the eyes, may be properly called clearing of them; in this, and in no other ſenſe, doe I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the thing to bee cleared by what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath before ſaid.</p>
                           <p>Where he laies down this caution, (<hi>I doe not here take Faith for any one ſingle act, but as I ſhall afterward explain it</hi>) he might have ſpared the labour to tell us ſo: For wee ſee what himſelf ſeeth, that ſo to take it, would bee a ruinating blow to the moſt of the foregoing and following doctrines about Juſtification, conteined in this his book.</p>

Chriſt fully ſatisfieth for this tranſgreſſion, and buyeth the priſoners into his own hands; and maketh with them a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: That whoſoever will accept of him, and beleeve in him who hath thus ſatisfied, it ſhall be as effectuall for their Juſtification, as if they had fulfilled the Law of Works themſelves.</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:167891:112"/> the Tenant, if he ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to deny the payment of the pepper-corn. In this caſe the payment of the grain of pepper is imputed to the tenant, as if he had payed the rent of the old Leaſe. Yet this imputation doth not extoll the pepper corn, nor vilifie the benefit of his benefactor, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him. Nor can it be ſayd that the purchaſe did onely ſerve to advance the value and efficacy of that graine of pepper. But thus, a perſonall Rent must be payd for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his homage.

The value of Chriſts ſatisfaction is imputed to us in ſtead of the value of a perfect obedience of our own perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the value of our Faith is not ſo imputed.

                           <p>I ſhould have left this paſſage, as meerly windy, to the wind, finding nothing in it that hath the leaſt force to diſturb, or ſhake any wel-grounded Chriſtian. Only becauſe not all that are true Chriſtians, are alſo ſo well grounded and rooted in Chriſt, and built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets as could be deſired; but not a few <hi>children in underſtanding whirled to and fro with every winde of doctrine;</hi> for prevention of their ſliding I ſhall ſay ſomething, (and there is not much need of ſpeaking much) to it. Mr: <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhews himſelf to be a notable profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yea a perfitiſt in the art of Impoſture. As hee hath his feats and ſhifts of ſophiſtry ſtill in readineſs to beguile them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:167891:113"/> to learning; ſo he hath, and here makes uſe of his <hi>good words and fair ſpeeches,</hi> ſmoothneſſe of language, and a ſhew without ſubſtance of reaſon, which the Holy Ghoſt affirms to be the common ſlight of falſe teachers, <hi>to deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> Rom. 16. 17, 18.</p>
                           <p>His ſcope here ſeemes to be two-fold. 1. To hold himſelfe in favour with the Arminians his younger brothers, and kindly to draw them with him up to a full cloſure with the Papiſts, the worſt of Papiſts, to ſpeak not onely the ſame thing, but alſo the ſame words with him, and them in the point of Juſtification. 2. To delude and charme with golden words of painted vanity, in ſtead of ſound verity, the weak and unwary Chriſtians among us, into a confederacy with him in his opinions. 1. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the former part of his aim and purpoſe, it is evident, that though the <hi>Arminians</hi> are led by the ſame ſpirit with the Papiſts, and as much as we can underſtand by their writings, have even ſacrificed themſelves to drive on the Papiſts intereſts; yet they ſpeak not altogether ſo broad and home as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> doth in the Popiſh dialect in this point of juſtification. The times of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> his declaring themſelves for the Popiſh ſynagogue, were not one and the ſame. Here Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> hath the advantage of <hi>Arminius,</hi> &amp; improves it diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Arminius</hi> was to broach his doctrine in Common-wealth; where he knew he ſhould have all the Magiſtracy, Miniſtry and people alſo, on a ſudden, riſing up with co-united ſtrength to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him; yea all the Magiſtrates and Miniſters of the reformed Churches round about, bringing their co-united help to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his wild-fire. Needfull was it therefore for him in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſpeak warily, <hi>&amp; non repente fieri turpiſſimum:</hi> not at once to diſcover himſelfe at the worſt.</p>
                           <p>The times do better ſerve Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> purpoſes, Providence hath caſt him upon a people of itching ears, at a time when the promoting and admitting of Monſtroſities in opinions is the faſhion mainly in requeſt in religion, the moſt, like the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> harkening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It behoved him therefore, for the full at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:167891:113"/> of his deſigns, to make uſe of the opportunity, to ſtrike home, and to the purpoſe, while the iron is hot, and having his mouth once open, to vomit out all the <hi>poyſon</hi> in his belly in one floud, while there are ſo many mouthes and bellies open to receive it. Hence it is, that <hi>Arminius</hi> and his followers, though they had as good ſtomacks as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> yet did not open their mouthes as wide as hee in Babel language. Though they ſpake the <hi>tantundem,</hi> yet they ſpared to utter the <hi>idem,</hi> with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to obſcure the Grace of God in our Juſtification. They ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not (as the Papiſts do) <hi>Faith the very, or part of the very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which juſtifieth of it ſelf,</hi> but that which is imputed to us for, or in ſtead of perfect righteouſneſs, to Juſtification, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not that it juſtifieth by its own inherent virtue, or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to bee graciouſly accepted for righteouſneſſe at Gods tribunall. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>hath merited for us, that our Faith ſhould be accepted, and eſteemed of God, for, and in place of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of the Law, to juſtifie us in his ſight.</hi> In ſubſtance they ſpeak the ſame thing with, but in words they are ſomewhat more favourable, and modeſt then the Jeſuits. But Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> doth not thus ſpeak thorow his teeth liſping, to mince the matter, but having the advantage of a good wind and tide, (as hath been ſaid) hoyſeth ſayles, and is at once carried into the very <hi>Lateran</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> through the ſtreams of <hi>Tibris;</hi> and ſpeakes out in the Romiſh tone, aſſerting Faith to be the perſonall righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtified, and makes the righteouſneſs of Faith a collateral with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to our juſtification. Yet doubting his good friends the Arminians will be angry for his poſting before them, and finding them in reverence to their Father <hi>Arminius,</hi> yet ſticking to, and loath to depart from his words, that Faith is but imputed for righteouſneſs, he calls back (notwithſtanding all his haſte) to them, inviting them to follow him; for he is ſtill of the ſame mind with them, and endeavours to ſhew them, that Faith it ſelf may be our righteouſneſſe, and yet be imputed to us for righteouſneſſe alſo. Which alſo he doth ſo graphically paint out to them, that they may (if they will not be too wayward) eaſily perceive, that they may own the Pope for their Father, and be nevertheleſs the genuine ſons of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſtill. What effect his fine words will take upon the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I know not, I care not. Only this was requiſite to be made out to be one end that he had in this paſſage of his, that we might
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:167891:114"/> the better know the man what he is: One that hangs ſo cloſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the bur to the garment; yet holds ſweet correſpondence with the <hi>Arminians</hi> too, to draw them to ſo full a diſcovery of themſelves, as himſelf hath made of himſelf.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In reference to the weake, and unwary Chriſtians among our ſelves, his aime is to faſten both the Popiſh and Arminian doctrines before mentioned upon them; and that not by ſtrong arguments of Scripture, whereof he is wholly deſtitute in this point, but by fine paints and flouriſhes of words, and delightful fimilies, pretending much ſweetneſs and innocency in thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, having learned of his forefathers that images are Laymens beſt books, <hi>viz.</hi> to carry them into idolatry &amp; error, and pictures are of more force to work upon the ignorant, then ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. To prevent therefore what evill is intended to them, I ſhall give theſe few premunitions.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, that the queſtion it ſelf propoſed by him, is meerly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; <hi>If Faith be our Righteouſneſs it ſelf, how is it ſaid to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for Righteouſneſs?</hi> as if Faith either as an act or duty, or habit of Evangelical righteouſneſs, were imputed to us for, and in ſtead of the perfect fulfilling of the righteouſnes of the Law to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. This he takes as granted, whereas it is one cheif thing in queſtion. All the reformed Churches, with their Teachers &amp; Paſtors have unanimouſly denyed both that faith is our juſtify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing righteouſnes; and that it is imputed to us for righteouſnes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then as it is inſtrumental to apprehend Chriſt to be our righteouſneſs, or the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath made for us, to be imputed to us for, and inſtead of that righteouſnes which conſiſteth in fulfilling the Law.</p>
                           <p>2. As to the <hi>plain</hi> and poſitive <hi>anſwer</hi> which he makes to the queſtion: Though we grant what he ſaith of our unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Chriſts ſatisfaction, and purchaſe of the priſoners; yet in that which hee addeth of the covenant that hee makes with the priſone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus he ſeems to leave the Papiſts (which he would not do for a world I think) which hold that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both by Chriſts righteouſneſs and our own righteouſnes alſo: and to joyn onely with the Socinians, which hold that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied onely by faith imputed to us for righteouſnes, and not by the righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction of Chriſt at all. For if this beleeving be by the vertue of Chriſts Covenant as effectuall to Juſtification as our fulfilling of the law of works could have been, then is there no need of any act or ſuffering or ſatisfaction of Chriſt to be imputed to us. For whoſoever ſhall fullfill the law ſhall have no need of a Mediator to juſtifie him. Therefore neither he that ſo beleeveth &amp;c. But how hard is it for a man that oppugneth truth and propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth error by meer fallacies againſt the light of his Conſcience, to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:167891:115"/> keep himſelf free from Contradictions; here he Contradicts what he had before ſaid of Chriſt our righteouſnes; and in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the following ſimilitude we ſhall find him in ſubſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting what he here ſaith. Touching all thoſe things which a little before I have affirmed his meaning to be ſo and ſo; let none demand how I know what is in another mans heart: himſelf in the following part of this Tractate fully diſcovers it, as we ſhall finde by reading and examining it. Neither will any queſtion it but they that have not read him, or in reading have not underſtood him. Thus much to his <hi>plain anſwer</hi> before he diſcends to his ſimilitude which he uſeth as ſugar to lap &amp; roll it up in, that it may go down pleaſantly. In this anſwer we finde nothing but words, his own words, not the leaſt pittance of Gods word to authorize it; he ſaith all, and with the ſame facility we deny all. Proceed we after him now to his ſimilitude.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 As to his ſimilitude, firſt I except that <hi>Similitudines</hi> or rather <hi>Similia illuſtrant, non probant.</hi> Similitudes are of good uſe to illuſtrate and make Cleer to the underſtanding that which is before proved to be a truth; but of no uſe to prove that which is unproved and the thing ſtill in queſtion. That which Mr. <hi>Br</hi> hath before Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his anſwer, was that Faith is both the righteouſnes it ſelf by which we are juſtified, and 2 that it is alſo imputed to us for and in ſtead of Juſtifying righteouſnes: <hi>viz.</hi> the very Goſpel Righteouſnes, imputed for and in ſtead of the legall righteouſnes. He hath ſaid it without any addittament of Scripture or reaſon to prove it; ſo that his ſimilitude here is brought to illuſtrate onely a phantaſm of his own brain, not any doctrine of Gods word.</p>
                           <p>2 I except againſt the ſimilitude it ſelf as being in its matter and form altogether incongruous to illuſtrate the doctrine of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, which the Goſpel holds forth to us; becauſe it hath (beſides other) theſe following incongruities to it.</p>
                           <p>1 Though (as in the poſitive anſwer before we did, ſo here) we grant what he ſaith of the Tenants forfeiture, unablenes to pay, expulſion from the inheritance, caſting into priſon; his Landlords ſon paying the debt for him, delivering him out of priſon, putting him into his houſe again as his Tenant, having purchaſed the houſe and all to himſelf; (provided alway that all this be done by the will of the Father the firſt Landlord, which Mr. <hi>Br</hi> doth not deny,) And though we pardon to Mr. <hi>Br</hi> (upon Condition that he do ſo no more) that he ſpeaks here more orthodoxly than he purpoſed,

                              <hi>viz.</hi> the priſoners debt to be ſatisfied, the priſoner to be delivered, &amp; reſtored to his houſe, to the inheritance again by the meer grace and purchaſe of the Son, before God; which implyes no leſs than a full juſtification with &amp; by God, before ever the priſoner beleeved, or had a new Leaſe, a new Covenant of grace and faith made with him; a doctrine which before Mr. <hi>Br</hi> anathematizeth to hell it ſelf: and will do ſo again; though he thereby Curſe himſelf for that which inconſiderately here fell from him: Theſe things granted and winked at: we utterly explode all the reſt in the Similitude not onely as uncoherent with, but as contrary to the doctrine of Grace, yea utterly deſtructive to the nature and working of grace in our Juſtification; and that in theſe particulars, as I promiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to ſpecifie. 1 That it maketh our Juſtification mercenary, and held by yeerly rent: for though it be but a pepper-corn that is payd, yet that is rent and payment, (as ſhall be manifeſted before we paſſe from this ſimilitude) which is contrary to the Covenant of grace, and doctrine of the Goſpel which affirmeth, that <hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace through the Redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. And wholly agreeing with the doctrine of the Goſpel is that of <hi>Auſtin; Non enim gratia Dei Gratia erit ullo modo, niſi gratuita ſit omni modo.</hi> The Grace of God ſhall not be grace in any reſpect, except it be free in every reſpect. But how is it free which is a debt acquired and held by rent and payment? 2 That it maketh our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Conditionall, if Articles of Covenant be performed then the Tenant abides in the inheritance, the man is juſtified, if through fooliſhnes or forgetfulnes unperformed, then is the Tenant outted, the man unjuſtified. And to be thus conditionally Juſtified is no Juſtification. When contrariwiſe the Goſpel holds forth a reall and abſolute Juſtification, <hi>Son, Daughter, Be of good cheare, thy ſinns he forgiven,</hi> Mat. 9. 2. Luk. 7. 48. <hi>He that is waſhed needeth not, ſave to waſh his feet, but is clean every whit,</hi> Joh. 13. 10. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, and glory in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. 3. Is it not a reall and abſolute, but a conditionall forgivenes, waſhing, Juſtifying here ſpoken of? then muſt the effects in theſe places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and attributed to ſuch forgivenes waſhing &amp; Juſtifying, be not reall but conditionall alſo.

Thus mans juſtification is made faſt or looſe, according to the ſtedfaſtnes or mutableneſs of mans will, and the grace of God in juſtifying, of ſo little fixedneſs that a pepper-corn can weigh it and ſway it up and down at pleaſure. When contrariwiſe the Scripture every where pronounceth the grace of God, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, everlaſting, unchangeable; and makes the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of man to reſt not upon his own mutable and mad will, but upon the ſtable and ſtabliſhing grace of God. <hi>I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſinns and iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will putt my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. with a large heap of teſtimonies more to the ſame purpoſe, which would be here impertinent to tranſcribe.</p>

That theſe <hi>Heretikes the Lutherans</hi> are the Curſed enemies unto Chriſt and grace, in denying our Righteouſneſs available to juſtifie and ſave us, ſo ſtreightening the vertue and power of Grace and of Chriſt, as being unable to infuſe vertue and efficacy into our righteouſneſs to juſtifie and ſave us, but more fully of this in a more proper place. The ſame paint doth <hi>Arminius</hi> uſe to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable if not plauſible his imputation of the Act of Faith to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as his very words are alleaged by Mr. <hi>Pemble.</hi> No marvell
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:167891:117"/> then if Mr. <hi>Br</hi> hath proficiently learned at the feet of ſuch <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leels.</hi> But what force or ſhew of ſubſtance is there in his and their ſo peeviſh ſhifts and evaſions? It is as he that brake up a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe, killed the Maſter and enriched himſelf with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof, with this mentall reſervation, that the Act ſhould be without any guilt of Murther before God, or of felony before men. And what either God or man could then lay any thing to his Charge. So Mr. <hi>Br</hi> with thoſe whom he followeth, robs God of the glory of his grace, and Chriſt of the honour of his merits, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the righteouſneſs of their own Faith and works therewith: but with this proviſo firſt layd in their fancies, and after ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to with their hands, that God and his Chriſt muſt not take their grace and righteouſnes herein wronged, nor mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extolled, nor the actors therein offenders: and when they have layd all things ſo ſure, what hath God or man to ſay againſt them?</p>
                           <p>Yet is there one inconvenience, and the ſame a ſhrewd one, that Gods way of reckoning in the point of Juſtification was fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this of Mr. <hi>Br</hi> and his Maſters, and without any Conſultation with them about it, by means whereof it runs right Contrary to theirs. And it is much to be feared becauſe he is God, he will not now Change. He hath in this point ſet ſo in direct oppoſition mans righteouſneſs and Gods righteouſneſs, grace and works, that both Cannot, ſhall not Conſiſt together, but either exclude and fruſtrate the other. It muſt be <hi>onely Gods righteouſneſs or onely mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (according to his rule) by which we muſt be juſtified; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits all medleyes, will have no mixture of heaven and of earth, of the Spirit and of the fleſh, the oxe and the aſſe muſt not be yoked together in this buſines: he that brings any of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fruſtrates to himſelf the Grace and righteouſneſs of God: He that truſteth to grace, and putts on by Faith the <hi>righteouſneſs of God,</hi> muſt <hi>derelinquiſh his own righteouſneſs</hi> to be found in Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone unto Juſtification, <hi>Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. Rom. 10. 3, 4. Phil. 3. 9. If by Grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace, otherwiſe work is no more work,</hi> Rom. 11. 6. And other ſuch like Scriptures which in the more proper place I ſhall produce. What will Mr. <hi>Br</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at Gods tribunal for raiſing his pepper-corn as a mount from which to batter the impregnable grace and righteouſneſs of God? If this doth not, what can extoll his pepper-corn?</p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:167891:117"/>
                           <p>To conclude what I have to ſay to the foreſaid words of Mr. <hi>Br,</hi> let him not take pepper in the noſe (as the Country phraſe is) if I take a grain or two of his own looſe powder to blow up his pepper-corn, that it may not be abuſive to the feeble and ſimple Chriſtians. If theſe will but conſider well theſe two things; firſt, what he means by his pepper-corn? ſecondly, how farr he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe, or extoll it, they ſhould eaſily ſee his ſubtlety, and keep their foot from being taken in this his ſnare laid for them. Both theſe are to be gathered from himſelf. Touching the former he means by the pepper-corn, the whole righteouſneſs of man, the entire righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which the Law requireth in the full ſubſtance, though not in the full degree which the Law requireth it, all perſonall vertues and duties which the morall Law injoyned upon men. This is cleer enough by what he hath ſaid before, hinted by that which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth in the application of this Similitude when he ſaith, <hi>Even ſo is our Evangelicall Righteouſneſs or Faith,</hi> inſinuating that by Faith he means all that Can be brought under the notion of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call righteouſneſs in his ſenſe, which is all that the Law Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and the Goſpel approveth as righteouſneſs: and in the following part of his Treatiſe when he Comes to the Anatomizing of his Faith here ſpoken of, he doth in expreſs words affirm &amp; ſeek to confirm it. Here is a pepper-corn able like <hi>Moſes</hi> his rod-ſerpent, to eat up all the pepper-corns of the Eaſt-Indies. Poſſibly the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Soveraign was built to fetch it from the Eaſt Indies to us, it being too great a fraught for any other Shipp in <hi>England.</hi> And it muſt not be divided, for a peece will do no good in this buſines, but the whole is required. Doth not the weakeſt Chriſtian here ſee diſcovered the Cunning of the man that would have them to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch a pepper-corn, ſuch a Camel into themſelves? What room would be left then for Chriſt? which of the Phariſees of old or of the Papiſts in latter ages, have more extolled mans righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or more fully aſcribed ſalvation to works? onely though they uſed terms equipollent to Cover their falſhood, yet they did not hit upon the pepper-corn, to delude poor ſouls with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that if there were any difference between their doctrine and the Doctrine of the Scriptures, yet was it as ſmall as the weight and worth of a pepper-corn, ſo that they might be followed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger.</p>
                           <p>Touching the latter, how farr he will extoll the pepper-corn of our own workes and righteouſneſs to Juſtification and ſalvation,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:167891:118"/> he doth not here (though afterward he doth) in expreſs words ſignifie. But that he means to extoll them, he doth enough plainly give us to underſtand: When he ſaith that the purchaſe did not <hi>Onely</hi> ſerve to advance the value and efficacy of that grain of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his meaning muſt be (at leaſt) that Chriſt dyed and by his death hath purchaſed to the pepper-corn of mans righteouſneſs, a value and efficacy in part, though not <hi>Onely</hi> to Juſtifie us, ſo that our righteouſneſs muſt go Cheek by Cheek with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to Juſtification. Now as if Uſury as it Conſiſteth in taking increaſe, be unlawfull, a penny of a hundred pounds taken by way of increaſe, is no leſs in ſubſtance Uſury and unlawfull, than the taking of Tenn pounds of the hundred: ſo if the adding of our righteouſneſs to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for our juſtification, be an unlawfull exalting of our own, and depreſſing of Chriſts righteouſneſs, then to bring our own righteouſneſs with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt in the leaſt part to juſtifie, is as truly an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full depreſſion of Chriſts righteouſneſs and advancing of our own, as if we brought it in the higheſt degree wholly and alone to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us: and ſo by his account Chriſt dyed to make man, though not the <hi>Onely,</hi> yet in part a ſaviour of himſelf. And herein to follow his doctrine is the ready way to be a ſelf-deſtroyer. <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect to you whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are faln from grace,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle to a people, that did extoll but in part and not <hi>Onely</hi> their own righteouſneſs to juſtification. Though it be not <hi>Onely</hi> poyſon which a man eateth, yet it there be poyſon in it, it brings death after i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>. If we magnifie one grain of our own pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that height that we make it a part of that righteouſneſs by which to ſtand at Gods tribunall this one grain will ſink us down to hell, ſo hot a poyſon is Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> pepper-corn.</p>

                              <hi>Bax.</hi> Two things are conſiderable in this debt of righteouſneſs: The value and the perſonall performance or intereſt. The value of Chriſts ſatisfaction is imputed to us, in ſtead of the value of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience of our own performing; and the volue of our Faith
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:167891:118"/> is not ſo imputed: But becauſe there muſt be ſome perſonall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of homage, therefore the perſonall performance of Faith ſhall be imputed to us for a ſufficient perſonall payment, as if we had payd the full Rent, becauſe Chriſt whom we beleeve in, hath payd it, and he will take this for ſatisfactory homage; ſo it is in point of perſonall performance, and not of value, that faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</q>
                           <p>It is not denyed but a perſonall teſtification of homage is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. We were not Redeemed to be independent, or our own Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords and Maſters, to ſerve our ſelves and walk after our own thoughts. No; <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Therefore glorifie God in your body and in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which are Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. And again, <hi>He hath given himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> We muſt live and dye to him that dyed for us in teſtification of our homage. But the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not whether this homage is to be done, but whether when it is performed, it be a Cauſe or an effect of our redemption and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; Whether we are to perform all duty that we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and juſtified, or becauſe we are redeemed and juſtified. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the relation of the perſons go before the relative duties, or the relative duties before the relation of the perſons. Reaſon tells us that filiall obedience doth alway preſuppoſe the relation of a Son, and where there is no Childe there can be expected no Childlike obedience. Firſt free and then free ſervice. And to this tenor runs the vote and voyce of the Goſpel. <hi>We are delivered out of the hands of our enemies, that we may ſerve him without fear, in holines and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before him all the dayes of our life,</hi> Luk. 1. 74, 75. Not that we ſhall be delivered out of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe we have ſo ſerved him all the dayes of our life. <hi>That we are married to Chriſt, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> Rom. 7. 4.

That <hi>he dyed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15.

                        <p>I joyn theſe two together becauſe of their affinity either to other, and annex them to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the 23 <hi>Theſis,</hi> becauſe of their dependance on it, ſtanding or falling with it; there being no new thing in ſubſtance, but in degrees onely, here aſſerted. In the 23 <hi>Theſ.</hi> he had aſſerted a perſonall Righteouſneſs of our own, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and effectuall to Juſtification: Here leaſt he ſhould ſeem a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:167891:120"/> Brother to any of the Jeſuites, he mounts himſelf Check-mate with the worſt of them in his gradations, affirming that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own to Juſtification, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 24. to be a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>Theſ.</hi> 26. a <hi>Meritorious Righteouſneſs.</hi> Hath any of the moſt zealous Children of <hi>Babylon</hi> raiſed his ſcaffolds higher, to exalt the pinacles thereof to a more ſtupendous height?</p>
                        <p>There ſhall not be need of ſpeaking much by way of anſwer to him in theſe poſitions and their explications: For he doth here build Chimaera's upon Chimaera's, and nothings upon nothing. We deny, and ſo do all the true Churches of Chriſt, any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Righteouſneſs of man, as righteouſneſs neceſſary or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Juſtification, affirming that every imagination of ſuch righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as effectuall or ordeined to juſtifie, is a monſter begotten of the pride of mens hearts, which in the midſt of all their gawdy knowledge, never experimentally knew Chriſt, or the operation of that juſtification which is by Chriſt alone, upon their Conſciences. Neither hath Mr. <hi>Br</hi> brought any one reaſon worth a ruſh to prove ſuch a Righteouſneſs. So theſe two poſitions are anſwered in the laſt before it. There being no ſuch righteouſneſs: the blinde man may ſee that No righteouſneſs cannot be either a perfect or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Righteouſneſs; The ſubject <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> being evaporated, the accidents thereof [perfect and Meritorious] are turned to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours with it. The Adjects ſtand not, where the ſubject is diſſolved. It can be but an imaginary dreſs that is put on upon a meerly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary body. Yet I ſhall look after Mr. <hi>Br</hi> in his imaginations, if peradventure there fall from him any thing here and there deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an animadverſion.</p>
                        <p>In the Explication of the 24 <hi>Theſis</hi> he ſpends two whole pages, <hi>viz.</hi> 130, 131, in ſpitting of wit, and playing with his imaginary perfection of perſonall Righteouſneſs unto Juſtification, as with a ſhuttle-cock, here I hit you, there I miſſed you, there you were mine, here I came ſhort of you; and when he hath taken his fill of this game, in the laſt line of <hi>pag.</hi> 131. and ſo forward in the next page, confeſſeth that all this is nothing to his meaning or purpoſe, [and yet is it full to it.] Nothing to his purpoſe or meaning, in reference to the explication much leſs to the proving of a perſonall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs required to Juſtification, or a perfection of ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: yet full to his purpoſe to delight and allure to him ſuch as have nimble wits but dull Conſciences, how ſhould theſe but run after him finding more wit and art, in theſe two pages of his, than
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:167891:120"/> ever they met with in all the doctrine of the dull Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, though they ſhould add to them their Maſter alſo.</p>
                        <p>Well, <hi>Haec non ſucceſſit, alia aggrediamur via.</hi> That which he hath ſaid is not home to his meaning: But that which he ſaith next ſhall come home to it. And what ſaith he? <hi>Nihil quod non dictum eſt priùs</hi> Onely that which he had ſaid before once and again. Holines is a quality, Righteouſneſs is not ſo, but the Modification of our Acts as to the Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Rule of the New Covenant in point of Juſtification. Here is nothing but what was ſaid before, and hath been anſwered before in our Examination of the Explication of the former <hi>Theſis.</hi> But he adds which is not varyed <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minùs,</hi> alleaging <hi>Schibl. Metaph. li. 2. ca. 9. Tit. 7. Art.</hi> 2. His word <hi>Which,</hi> I conceive he will have to relate, not to the Rule which was the next Antecedent, for this ſerves nothing to his purpoſe: but to the more remote Antecedent, which he calls the <hi>Modification of our Acts,</hi> or cur righteouſnes to Juſtification, that it is not varied <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Magis &amp; Minùs.</hi> Indeed <hi>Schibler</hi> there concludes out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that Relations which have their foundation in ſubſtance or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, <hi>non recipiunt Magis &amp; Minùs,</hi> have no remiſſion or intenſion, but an equality, fullnes or perfection in their relation (if I may ſpeak a little unproperly to pleaſe Mr. <hi>Br.</hi>) But that Righteouſnes hath its foundation in ſubſtance he ſeems to deny, or that it hath its foundation in quantity, he ſaith but doth not prove. We ſay it hath its foundation in quality, &amp; ſuch relations <hi>Schibler</hi> there acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to admit <hi>Magis &amp; Minùs.</hi> Again <hi>Schibler</hi> addeth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, that <hi>Relata ex parte ſui, hoc est, ſecundum eſſe relationis ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, non recipiunt magis &amp; minùs.</hi> But this hinders not why in ſome yea ſundry other reſpects, they ſhould not admit it. And thus <hi>Schib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> doth him no good. Yet if <hi>Schibler</hi> were for him, I ſhould except that the Holy Ghoſt is not (ſpecially in Goſpel matters) a Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick, was never a diſciple of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his wiſdome is a Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks more tranſcendent above <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Metaphyſicks, than <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> Metaphyſicks are above his Phyſicks. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt takes the liberty in Scriptures, to affirm a <hi>Magis &amp; Minùs</hi> in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, to pronounce one more, and another leſs righteous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Rule, as hath been before ſhewed. Br. <hi>Therefore our Divines uſually ſay, that our Juſtification is perfect, though our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not: and then I am ſure our Righteouſnes muſt be perfect.</hi> A meer flam &amp; vanity of words! Our Divines (ſaith he) doth he own them? are they not ſuch as he would rather <hi>tollere</hi> than <hi>extollere?</hi> Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:167891:121"/> and yet not Popiſh Divines? our Divines uſually ſay that our Juſtification is perfect. But will Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſay ſo? Nay he ſaith point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank in oppoſition to it. Yet even hence would he force in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, &amp; then I am ſure our Righteouſnes muſt be perfect. A meer ſophiſm and fallacy: we grant that the righteouſnes by which we are perfectly juſtified, muſt needs be a perfect righteouſnes. But we deny that righteouſnes to be any otherwiſe ours than by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts ſatisfaction. As for the Righteouſnes of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which Mr. <hi>Br</hi> makes the condition of our juſtifying, we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny either to be perfect in this life, or to have any finger in the buſines of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>When he finds all his other ſhifts too weak to hide the nakednes of his Concluſion, at length he flyeth to his ſophiſticall diſtinctions according to his uſuall manner, to obſcure &amp; darken what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confirm &amp; clear up in the light to be of God. B: <hi>A twofold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is here implyed</hi> (ſaith he) 1 <hi>a Metaphyſicall perfection of Being, 2 A perfection of ſufficiency in order to its end.</hi> Theſe two he jumbles &amp; tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles together, ſomtimes into a Confuſion, &amp; then out of the Chaos that he hath made goes about to ſeparate them again into ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct order, ſo far that if there be any that can ſee things which are not as if they were, may diſcern either from other ſo perfectly at a diſtance that he ſhal never attain the one or the other as a perfection of Righteouſnes to his juſtification. The former he makes to be the <hi>Materiall entity of a non ens,</hi> (as he had before defined Righteouſnes) the Materiall Being of that which is not a being. And this, ſaith he, is the ſincerity of our faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> of our Sanctification (for ſo he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:) this is the firſt perfection of our own righteouſnes to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Let us ſuppoſe now that there is ſuch a Metaphyſicall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the ſincerity of our righteouſnes and the matter thereof, what doth this make to his purpoſe, that there is a perfection in our perſonall righteouſnes to juſtifie us? I ſhall demand theſe queſtions of him. 1 Whether a Metaphyſicall perfection of Being, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Righteouſnes be the perfection of righteouſnes which is required to juſtification? Is there not a Metaphyſicall being yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of being in the matter of all the Acts of righteouſnes which the very heathen and reprobates perform? 2 Whether Sincerity be perfection of righteouſnes, any further than it is more or leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, perfect ſincerity being a perfect perfection, unperfect ſincerity an unperfect perfection, perfect it may be in its Metaphyſicall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is unperfect in its degrees: But muſt there not be alſo a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:167891:121"/> perfection in a righteouſneſs perſonall that ſhall be perfect to juſtifie. 3 Whether there be not ſin &amp; imperfection in the beſt ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Saints during this life, a mixture of unbeleef with their faith, of fleſh with Spirit, of doublenes with their ſimplicity? 4 Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this mixture be not evill and a ſin in reference to the New, as well as to the Old Covenant? Why els doth the Lord Chriſt ſo oft reprove and upbraid his diſciples with the feeblenes of their Faith? <hi>O ye of little Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe of your unbeleef. Where is your Faith?</hi> and ſuch like? 5 Grant unto a man the greateſt ſincerity of Faith &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines attainable by the moſt ſpirituallized Chriſtians in this life, hath God ordeined it to be a perfect righteouſnes, or is it a perfect righteouſnes either in it ſelf, or to Juſtification? if ſo why doth the Apoſtle when he could profeſs not onely his perſonall obedience as a Chriſtian, but alſo his righteouſnes and integrity as a Miniſter, to be ſo far in ſincerity, and as in the fight of God, &amp; in Chriſt, that he knew nothing by himſelf, wherin he could accuſe himſelf as failing in ſincerity; nevertheles add, <hi>Yet am I not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. &amp; 2. 17. 1 Cor. 4. 4? This Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſeeth and that his reader may not ſee the weaknes of his Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call materiall Righteouſneſs, he therefore Confounds it with the Formality of it. Els ſhould he give every reader to retort upon him his own words <hi>pag.</hi> 121. that he pronounceth that a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes which is unrighteous, hatefull and accurſed, being a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes which in its matter is injoyned by the old Covenant, &amp; hath for its rule in the matter thereof the Law of the old Covenant ſtill.</p>
                        <p>No leſs vain alſo is that which he diſcourſeth of the Formality of this perſonal righteouſnes, that it is a perfect righteouſnes <hi>in reſpect of its perfect ſufficiency in order to its end, which is to be a condition of our Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſhall attain. The tenor of the New Covenant is not, Beleeve in the higheſt degree and you ſhall be juſtified, but beleeve ſincerely and you ſhall be juſtified. So that our righteouſneſs. 1. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally conſidered in relation to the conditions of the New Covenant, is either perfect or none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer that God hath ordeined no righteouſnes of ours as our Righteouſnes, to be a Condition of the New Covenant. 2. If he had ſo done, yet it follows not thence that the ſame Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes performed, is a perfect righteouſnes, though it be ſufficient and effectuall to the end to which God ordeined it to be performed. God required the uſe and ſound of Trumpets and voices to deſtroy and lay levell with the earth, the ſtrong walls and Towers of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho;</hi>
                           <pb n="186" facs="tcp:167891:122"/> and the waſhing in <hi>Jordan</hi> to Clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe were ordeined as ſeverall Conditions in order to thoſe ſeverall ends; and being performed became ſufficient and effectuall to the attainment thereof. Shall we ſay then, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe Conditions was their perfect righteouſnes which performed them? So neither if God had appointed Faith which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Br</hi> is ſanctification, as a Condition of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the performance thereof our perfect righteouſnes. 3 This ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of that which Mr. <hi>Br</hi> calleth perfect righteouſnes in order to its end, is no more in &amp; from it ſelf, than the before-mentioned noyces and waſhings were in themſelves, to the attainment of their ends: But the ſufficiency thereof is wholly from the righteouſneſs faithfulnes and all ſufficiency of God to fullfill the promiſes of his grace. So that what he ſaith of beleeving in the higheſt degree, and beleeving in ſincerity, is beſides the matter in queſtion; Both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if they could be performed according to the tenor of the new Covenant, not being of ſufficiency to make up a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Therefore we conclude in Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> words, <hi>That our Righteouſnes formally conſidered in relation to the condition of the new Covenant, is ſo far from being a perfect Righteouſneſs, that it is none at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have nothing els to ſay againſt that wherewith he concludes his explication of the <hi>Theſis,</hi> enumerating the many reſpects in which this imaginary righteouſnes of man is imperfect, and conſequently ſinfull; But this that it diſplayes the ſin and impudency of the man, that he will call that a perfect righteouſnes, which himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be ſo deficient, rotten, and unrighteous.</p>

                        <p>The explication in reference to this part of the <hi>Theſis</hi> hath nothing that may be called an addition to it.

But thus farr of his aſſertion which we have found full of the Leaven, or rather to be the Leaven it ſelf of the Scribes and Phariſees both of the former and latter ages. Let us ſee now how he lenifieth &amp; ſweeteneth it, that his ſacrilege in rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of the honour of his grace appear not.</p>

Can he name any one of the worſt Papiſts or Jeſuits that doth attribute Merit to mans works in a higher degree than, or doth not when he hath extolled mans Merits, ſalve the grace of God as finely as himſelf? Are not his words and theirs about Gods Grace and mans merits the ſame? Doth he add any thing here of his own that he hath not learned of them? <hi>We cannot merit</hi> (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Alas, ſaith he, <hi>There is nothing in the value of our works, or any benefit that God receives by them, that may entitle them Meritorious; Neither is there any proportion between them and the Reward.</hi> Do not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his brethren ſpeak altogether ſo fully &amp; more fully, ſeemingly to vindicate the grace of God from all ecclipſing by their doctrine of Merit? <hi>Merit as ſtrictly and properly taken</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt be, 1 Ex proprijs, 2 ex indebitis, 3 Ad aequalitatem. 1 It muſt be of ſomething of our own which we have not received; 2 of that which we were not indebted or bound to perform; 3 It muſt come up to a full

                        <p>As for the two fold oppoſition which he puts in his <hi>Theſis,</hi> 1. between the conditions of the Old Covenant &amp; New, 2. Between the power which <hi>Adam</hi> had by nature, and the power which we have by the Grace of Chriſt; there is nothing but a windy ſound of words therein, to deceive his reader into an opinion that he hath ſome honeſt and ſound meaning in what is here poſited or ſaid. For neither doth he make any real difference between the conditions of theſe two Covenants: but makes our own Righteouſneſſe, conſiſting in faith and works, to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the conditions of both Covenants, onely he puts a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed difference in the meaſure of them: One, an imaginary perfection of ſincerity in doeing them, anſwering to what the New Covenant requireth; the other, an abſolute and gradual perfection in doing them without the leaſt particle omitted or committed, beſides or againſt the rigorous exaction of the Old Covenant. And this is a difference made up of a mans dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fancy without any leaſt footing that it hath in, or ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Word of God; which utterly ſhakes off all mans righteouſneſs, works, and qualifications in either, and both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from having any thing to do in the buſineſſe of juſtification under the New Covenant, as hath been in part already, and ſhall be in its due place (if God will) more fully demonſtrated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>Nor doth he mean 2 things, by <hi>Adams</hi> power by nature, and our power by Grace. Nature there, and grace here, to him are one &amp; the ſame. For was not the power which <hi>Adam</hi> had to ſtand, a power received by Grace? what a malignant eye hath he, ſo extremely to envie the raies of Gods Grace, when they luſtre, and by their brightneſs diſcover the dimneſſe and invalidity of mans nature? He will own no longer <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> himſelfe to be the <hi>Magiſter,</hi> if he affirm (as hee doth affirm) that the power which <hi>Adam</hi> had to fulfill the conditions of the Old Covenant, was (not by grace, but) by nature; or what means he by the grace of Chriſt now? doth he under this word point out any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power than every man hath or may have, that is no more Chriſtified, or Spirituallized now, than <hi>Adam</hi> was then? yea than he was immediately after his fall? This book of his in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parcels of it doth (not obſcurely) inſinuate thus much of him; and if we judge amiſſe, it is his fault in writing ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly and refuſing to explain his own meaning that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth

                        <p>But as to the thing it ſelfe here poſited by Maſter <hi>Baxter:</hi> wee utterly deny that God hath ever given, or any where promiſed to give unto the beſt of men in the ſtate of ſinfull infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And theſe are the things which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here either with the grace, or without, and againſt the grace of God contendeth for; but neither hath, nor ever will have the grace of God, from the Word of God, to prove and demonſtrate; though he bangle and bungle never ſo much with his looſe ſhifts of Sophiſtry, to give out an appearance to them that are more delighted with appearance then with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as if he had done it.</p>

                        <p>What is here meant by the Morall Law muſt bee firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, before there can be any well-grounded conſenting, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in judgements about the force in which it yet ſtandeth. Both the word <hi>Law,</hi> and the word <hi>Moral,</hi> have their ambiguity, and are uſed in divers ſenſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The word <hi>Law</hi> is taken ſometimes onely for a rule, or guide, or directive, to give us light to diſcern between truth and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, good and evill, lawfull and unlawfull; to which alſo may be added, a power therein to command duty, and to prohibit, what is contrary to duty. Sometimes it is taken in a larger ſenſe

Here I conceive Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> taketh the word <hi>Law</hi> in the former ſenſe onely, becauſe pag. 156. in anſwer to the firſt queſtion, he diſtinguiſheth, and puts a difference between the Covenant of Works, and the Morall Law, ſo plainly, as if he did, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> tell us that hee underſtands by the Morall Law, the rule and precepts of Holyneſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, as conſidered apart from the pactionary Adjunct of life and death going with it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The word <hi>Morall</hi> alſo hath its divers ſenſes; ſometimes Divines take it in a larger ſenſe, for all whatſoever pertaines to manners; and then by the Morall Law they underſtand all the Commandements, or Rules which God giveth for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our manners, in reference to the qualifications of the mind, and the outward operations alſo: Whether thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements bee either of naturall, or of poſitive right, written in mans heart at his creation, or had their firſt poſitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And then by the Moral Law they underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Decalogue, or Law of the ten Commandments: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Law of Nature, or naturall Righteouſneſs imprinted in mans heart at his firſt creation.</p>
                        <p>Here taking it for granted, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meaneth by the Morall Law, the doctrine of the Law conſidered as a rule of Righteouſneſs, not as a Covenant of Works:</p>
                        <p>If 1. he mean by the Morall Law all Commandements both of naturall and poſitive right; I deny the Morall Law ſo taken to be in the whole, and in every part now in force.</p>
                        <p>If 2. he mean by it the Decalogue, or Law of the tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, as it was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in time, ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knoweth it to bee the judgement of many Divines, that it bound the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alone, was not at all given to the Gentiles, doth not at all bind us that are not of the Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e of this judgement. Withall, that there are ſome things contained in ſome of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, not pertaining to the <hi>jus naturae,</hi> ſave in their <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and that ſomewhat remote, I know Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and if I thought any elſe would queſtion it, it were eaſie to be demonſtrated. But if he mean by the Morall Law, the Law of Nature, as aforeſaid, as it is written in the heart; yea as it is further illuſtrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by the book of the Creatures, or by the Decalogue, as it is epitomized in Tables of ſtone, and explained and amplified in both Teſtaments; ſo I grant the Moral Law to be ſtill in force; <hi>viz.</hi> as a directive of Moral obedience ſtill.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> addeth, [<hi>viz. to what ends, and in what ſenſe the Goſpel continueth that law, and commandeth perfect obedience thereto, is a queſtion not very eaſie</hi>] is to me a ſtrange ſpeech, in many reſpects. For 1. I cannot ſee how the queſtion can be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to him that will not <hi>Nodum in ſcirpo quaerere,</hi> make the plaine wayes of God rugged, by filling them up with bryars and thorns. To the ſame moſt honourable ends, and in the ſame ſenſe is it continued, for, and in which it was firſt given; I mean to the ſame ends in general, though not in every far remote particular. Firſt to make his glory elucent in this Microcoſm, this choice peece of his Workmanſhip: <hi>Man is the glory of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. How? but as he bears the image of God, not onely in rule and dominion, but alſo in wiſdome, holyneſs, and righteouſneſs, to manage that authority, and rule wherewith the grace of God hath inveſted him. And this glory of God upon man is by ſo much the more conſpicuous, by how much the more perfectly he reſembles God in wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and holyneſs.</p>
                        <p>Beſides it was both given and continued, to direct and enable man in ſome meaſure to render to God his Pepper-corn (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> terms it) in teſtification of his homage, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, both for the favours received, and for the favours promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: without the guidance of the Morall Law written without us, yea within us alſo, we ſhould, though our affections were never ſo ſweetly ſanctifyed, for lack of ſound illumination, preſent God with wild grapes in ſtead of grapes, with an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination inſtead of due obedience and devotion. And are not theſe ends as requiſite in the ſtate of mans Renovation, as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:167891:129"/> they were in the ſtate of his innocency?</p>
                        <p>Yea further, unpoſſible was it, that Chriſt ſhould not continue the Morall Law, no leſſe unpoſſible then it is for God to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, or not God: <hi>He came to fulfill all righteouſneſſe,</hi> not to deſtroy any one branch of naturall and eſſential righteouſneſs. The Morall Law is the image of God, in which we may read the nature of God: The rule and platform is in God himſelfe originally, this is but an extract from it, and abſtract of it. Chriſt came to reſtore it, not to quench it, to ſet it up in man to perfection, not to deface it by any diminution: For ſo ſhould he have abaſed the glory of his Father, ſhining in his living image.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, not to have commanded perfect, but a maimed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereto, had been againſt the rule of righteouſneſs, which bids us <hi>to render to every one his due, his whole due; To God the things that pertain to God;</hi> yea the whole that pertains to him. All is but a Pepper-corn to a whole kingdome of Grace held, and of glory expected from him; and ſhould not Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the payment of a Pepper-corn whole and entire, without diminiſhing, or dividing it?</p>
                        <p>But the truth is, that the queſtion is difficult to bee anſwered, without cruſhing Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Goſpel Juſtification by Works, not in reference to Chriſts Goſpel Juſtification by free Grace; with it the Commandement of perfect obedience to the Morall Law ſweetly cohereth. The command of perfect obedience to the Morall Law, as a condition of Juſtification, leaves all men hopeleſſe of Juſtification, ſure to condemnation for ever. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none can perform the condition in this life. But when we are juſtified freely by the blood of Chriſt; and then by way of anſwering the grace of our Juſtifier with our reall thankfulneſs, we are bidden to render our obedience more and more perfectly, not ſlacking our endeavours, untill we come to full perfection: Though we attain it not in this preſent life, yet our not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth but encreaſe our ſelf-abaſement, and make us feele that Chriſt is our all, and we are nothing; but doth in no wiſe deſtroy our Juſtification, or leſſen the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and peace of conſcience, which are bottomed only, and wholly upon Chriſt, and not upon our ſelves at all.</p>
                        <p>Now let us ſee how he will make the queſtion difficult to us, as it muſt be to him.</p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:167891:129"/>
                        <p>Firſt, ſaith he, it is a queſtion, <hi>Whether Chriſt did firſt repeale that Law, and then re-eſtabliſh it to other ends? So ſome think.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A meer windy queſtion of ſuch as delight to play with God in contempt, as the Froggs with <hi>Jupiters</hi> Log. Where are thoſe ſome thinkers? No leſſe rationally might they feign that the Lord Jeſus pluckt down his Father <hi>Joſephs</hi> houſe, &amp; re-edified it to this other end, that men might goe in and out no more at the doors, but at the windows.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> waſheth his hands clean from having a finger in this pye. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have proved already, that it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed at all, even concerning the Covenant of Works it ſelf. i. e.</hi> That Chriſt is ſo farre from taking from us the perfect rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that he (however hee be called a Saviour) yet hath left all men, without ſaving any, to be damned for their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.

But what title he hath to make ſuch a grant, he ſhews not. And I think it will coſt him ſo much labour as will make him ſweat under the ſaddle, before he be able to ſhew to what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſtantial, and not meerly circumſtantiall ends it now ſerveth, beſides thoſe to which it ſerved at the firſt creation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in mans innocency, at leaſt after his principles, that holdeth the workes thereof now under the Goſpel to tend to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        </q>
                        <p>Before he pretended a purpoſe to ſpeak of the Moral Law in it ſelfe, and as conſidered without the Covenants; but finding quickly that his Babel will not tower up out of ſimples, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either to let all fall, or elſe himſelfe muſt returne to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundings and confoundings again, now mixing the moral law with the olde, and by and by with the New Covenant, as a part ſometimes of the one, and ſometimes of the other; as if it were a Noun Adjective which cannot ſtand by it ſelfe. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the moral Law is the rule of righteouſneſſe, complete in it ſelfe, the very image of Gods Nature, and Will, to which every reaſonable creature is bound to conform, that it may be like to God himſelfe, and ſo illuſtrate either to other the ſplendor of Gods glory inviſible in himſelfe, but ſhining forth in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and performances. But the Covenants are ſeparable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts of the moral law, when annexed to the moral law, being free and voluntary Acts and Statutes of God, which hee might <hi>pro imperio,</hi> by the Soveraign authority which hee hath over his creatures, either have, or not have added to the moral law, at his pleaſure: The Old Covenant making out to men the way of Salvation in ſtrict, yet equal and uncorrupt Juſtice: The New Covenant, his way of ſaving ſinners, and juſtifying the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, by free grace, when in juſtice they were loſt and unreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable. The one of theſe is by the perfect fulfilling of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:167891:130"/> law; the other without reference to the moral law at all, freely by the redemption which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Here now, if both Covenants were ſilenced, and annihilated, yet the moral law would abide firm ſtill, it would as well without Covenant as by Covenant, ſpeak out mans duty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, both unjuſtified and juſtified, in his ſtate either of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity or infirmity, to be wiſe, holy and righteous, as God made him, and to act perfectly according to the perfect principles of acting firſt created in him; even without life and heaven before him to allure him, or death and hell behind him to enforce him. And ſo the moral law is no part of either Covenant eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that it cannot be ſeparated from it without its nullify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay it was in God from all eternity, and ſhall be in him ſtill, when all Covenants conditionall ſhall have their expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Yet let us follow Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> to ſee what buſineſſe hee will make in the dark, having thus obſcured the clear light of this doctrine by his mixtures and confoundings. Hee gives many anſwers to this 2 queſtion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>the moral law, as it is the preceptive part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, is but delivered over into the hands of Chriſt, and ſo continued in the ſenſe before expreſſed, ſeems plain to me.</hi> How clear are this mans eyes?

                        <p>For 1. I ſee not how the moral <hi>Law is the preceptive part of the Covenant of works.</hi> It contains in it I confeſſe the precepts of all good, juſt and holy operations, as it is the rule of all theſe. But how it is the preceptive part of the Covenant, being a diſtinct thing from it, the Covenant being added to it, and not it to the Covenant, I ſee not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How it is delivered over into the hands of Chriſt, and in what ſenſe, is hard for me to apprehend. Is it taken out of God in whom it was originally and eſſentially, &amp; ſo put into Chriſts hands, that it is no more to be found in God? or is that unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remainder of it which abode ſtill in the Syntereſis, or minde and conſcience of lapſed man, taken thence and put into the hands of Chriſt, that it is no more to be found in man, but that after Satan had felled down the ſtemm and branches thereof, Chriſt at laſt hath forced thence the very root thereof alſo, that

Or is it ſo put into Chriſts hand to diſpoſe of its being and office, that if he ſay the word, that which was ſhall bee no more natural or moral righteouſneſſe, much leſſe the perfect rule thereof; or that which was mans duty, and his conformity with the nature of God, if Chriſt will, ſhall be ſo no more?

                        <p>Firſt concerning obedience to the Morall Law, that it is part of the condition of the New Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I demand where it was before proved, yea where in direct words aſſerted, that it is here taken up as a point granted? Hee gave cauſe enough indeed to bee ſuſpected of it throughout the foregoing part of this Tractate, but not evidence enough to be impleaded for it. This is Magiſterially to command Faith, as one that ſpeaketh by the authority of an infallible ſpirit, and not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially to teach, as one that ſubjecteth himſelf and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the tryal of Gods Word.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I demand whether he means not by the condition of the New Covenant, the condition upon which, and for which God will juſtifie the performer? Yea that condition which he had before termed a righteouſneſſe perfect, and meritorious in its own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs to Juſtification? If this be not his meaning, then Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> eats up again to day what he ſpit out yeſterday. But this can in no wiſe befall the animoſity of his ſpirit. If it be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then doth he pronounce even our legal righteouſnes, which conſiſts in the fulfilling of the Morall duties of the Moral Law, as well as our Evangelicall righteouſneſſe (as he termes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall righteouſneſſe which is conformed to the rule of the Goſpel) to bee meritorious to Juſtification. And not any one of the Popes themſelves have ſpoken higher language then this, to deifie man in his own righteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I would be informed, if the performance of the duties of the Morall Law, in obedience to Chriſt doth juſtifie, why the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:167891:133"/> ſame performance in obedience to God, doth not juſtifie alſo? Is not obedience due as well to the Father, as to the Son? or is not Juſtification as much from the Father as from the Sonne? The ſame honour is due to both, and the ſame work of grace effected by both. Neither can I ſee any more worth in Morall Righteouſneſſe Morally performed (for I finde not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as yet ſpeaking further of it) in obedience to the Son, then in the ſame done to the Father by way of obedience to him. But of this point we ſhall have a more proper place and occaſion to ſpeak more fully afterward.</p>
                        <p>2. Concerning the ſecond, that the Goſpel doth require but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, not perfect obedience, I might alſo enquire,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth here take it up <hi>pro conceſſo,</hi> for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? He had indeed put it in the queſtion to which he is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but had ſaid nothing for the ſolution of it, except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by the art of <hi>Ventriloquie,</hi> he ſpake ſomething under the Table, that he might not bee heard, when hee ſaid in his firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, <hi>That the Morall Law is continued by Chriſt in the ſenſe before expreſſed,</hi> meaning by thoſe words, the expreſſions uſed in the ſaid queſtion, that under the New Covenant the Morall Law commandeth not perfect obedience, but onely ſincere, or at leaſt the Goſpel having the Morall Law for its preceptive part doth ſo. If I knew that to be his meaning, I have ſomewhat to ſay to it. In mean while, be it, or be it not his meaning, is every thing that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath once imagined in his brain, or ſpoken under a buſhel, by and by to be taken up for a granted principle in Religion, upon which he may make a ſuperſtructure of what he pleaſeth?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Why doth he not alledge thoſe Teſtimonies of the New Teſtament which aſſert onely a ſincere, and not a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Why doth hee ſuffer us poor ſoules to continue in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for lack of his light communicated to us? Is it in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or the inſide of his Teſtament that this myſtical doctrine is contained?

Yea if perfection were not the duty of a Chriſtian, and unperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmity his ſin; why doth the Apoſtle ſo much <hi>groan and grieve under the remainder of his naturall infirmities, and preſſe on to perfection?</hi> Rom. 7. 14, to the 24. <hi>Phi.</hi> 3. 12-14. Or is ſuch unperfectneſs a ſinne onely in reference to the rule of the Law, and not the rule of the Goſpel; for that the Law doth, but the Goſpel doth not call for perfection? This is both contrary to the Scriptures alleaged, and doth withall make the Goſpel to allow imperfections. And (to uſe Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own expreſſions, which calleth the Goſpel a Law) what the Law forbids not, we take the ſame to be approved by that Law.

But where is the man to bee found that can practically perform the duty? That Apoſtle which had laboured more abundantly then they all, profeſſed himſelf not to have compaſſed it, but that in the pureſt and livelieſt operations of the Spirit in him unto good, there was a counter-working of <hi>the fleſh in him, hindering the good which he willed, and turning it into the evill which he hated,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21-23. And the ſame he <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth alſo to be the caſe of all other the Saints of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. So that a perfect ſincerity he cannot mean, both becauſe he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Goſpel injoyneth perfect obedience, and perfection of ſincerity in this kinde is the higheſt pitch of the perfection that is in the moſt perfect obedience: And withall becauſe he tels us in the next anſwer, pag. 158. He knows not to what end Chriſt ſhould command us that obdience, which he doth never enable any man in this life to perform. And this hee hath layd downe for a maxime, That whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot find out, and fathom a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, and of it, meddle with it who liſteth, he will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with it. Or if he mean an unperfect ſincerity, that, according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is none at all. For if the righteouſneſſe of our perſons and actions bee, much more the ſincerity of our righteouſneſſe and obedience muſt be, not a being, but a modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a being, which doth not admit of <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> but muſt be perfect, or none at all. Yea what an abſurdity is it to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he, whoſe office it is to perfect his Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. that doth not only begin, but finiſh his good work in them, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that which is unperfect? Hee may be truly ſaid to wink at our unperfectneſs, to forgive our imperfections; but to ſay he commands that which is unperfect, is to deny the perfection of his commands, and ſo to lay imperfection to his charge, as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:167891:135"/> well as to our own. Beſides he may according to his cuſtom, if he be put to tell us what ſincerity he means, fall to diſtinguiſh it, into a Phyſical, or Metaphyſicall ſincerity, into a Morall, and an Evangelical ſincerity, ſo that although wee find many of his Meaſhes, yet ſhall we never find his Fourm: So full of doubles, and falſe leaps are they that deale not ſincerely in handling the doctrine of Chriſt, ſwaying and waving it hither and thither, to make it not ſubſervient to the advancing of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but of their own inventions. Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> labour rather practically, and feelingly to know the power of Chriſtian, and ſpiritual ſincerity within his heart, then to make uſe of the Word to make intricate the plain doctrine of Scriptures, and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhall finde that which we have hitherto unſucceſſefully ſought after, ſincere dealing in his diſputes. It is not all this while denyed, that the Goſpel requires ſincere obedience, but affirmed, that it calls for both ſincere, and perfect obedience.</p>
                        <p>I much doubt I ſhould ſlander Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if I ſhould ſay that hee means by ſincere obedience, ſincerely Evangelical obedience. For hee will not bee known to know what that is. It is beſides the Orb of Philoſophers, Scholaſticks, and Sophiſters, in which he moveth. But if beyond our beleef he meane ſo, then I ſhall conſent, and ſpeak with him, <hi>When the New Covenant ſaith, Thou ſhalt obey ſincerely,</hi> i. e. purely, according to the Goſpel rule, which teacheth us to fetch all our guidance, in every work of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to make it Evangelical, from the Word of Chriſt; all our ſtrength to doe it from the Spirit of Chriſt, all our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from our union to Chriſt, preſenting all, and our ſelves withall to God, through the mediation of Chriſt, doing all not to attain Juſtification by all done, but to glorifie God with the fruits of our thankfulneſs, for the prizeleſſe gift of Juſtification conferred upon us in, and through Chriſt.

My reaſon is, becauſe I know not to what end Chriſt ſhould command us that obedience, which hee never doth enable any man in this life to performe. If it were to convince us of our diſability and ſinne: That is the worke of the Law; and the continuing of it upon the old terms, as is before explained, is ſufficient to that.</p>

It ſufficeth me to know, what hath been a little before proved, that the Moral Law, both with reſpect, and as conſidered in it ſelf, without reſpect to either Covenant, hath been ever, is, and ſhall be ever the perfect rule and directory of Moral obedience; And that Chriſt, as the Mediator of the New Covenant, hath not diſſolved, or made voyd any part of the Morall Law, or of the Righteouſneſs and duty which the Moral Law requireth, in reference to either the ſincerity or perfection in performing the ſame; but contrariwiſe hath avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary, and denounced, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall break one of the leaſt of theſe commandements, and teach men ſo; i. e.</hi> as I conceive, ſhall take liberty by the abuſe, and miſunderſtanding of the New Covenant to neglect, or be remiſs in any part or degree of that righteouſneſs which the Law requireth, and teach others the ſame remiſneſſe alſo, <hi>The ſame ſhall be leaſt in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> i. e.

                        <p>But whether the Moral Law to them that are under the New Covenant, and truly in Chriſt, be onely a rule and directory, or elſe a commander alſo? Or whether Chriſt hath made the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law a proper part of his Goſpel, theſe are things Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous from the former, and firſt deviſed by thoſe diſtinctionary Sophiſters that to ſtrengthen their doctrine of merits and workes of ſuperogation, have diſtinguiſhed between the precepts and counſels of Chriſt. Sure I am, that the Goſpel in its ſtrict and proper ſenſe, conſiſts not at all in bringing precepts, but life, grace, righteouſneſs, peace, joy, holineſs, liberty, and ſalvation from heaven, and whatſoever elſe tendeth to the perfect and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ending welbeing of poor ſouls, together with an alſufficient light and direction how to attain all theſe, and manage them being attained, to the advancing of the glory of the grace of the giver. This is properly the ſumme of the Goſpel, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts intermixed with the doctrine hereof, no otherwiſe proper to the Goſpel, than as they are furtherances to the attainment of them, and lights and helps to direct us how to ſtand fixed in the enjoyment of them, and walk holily, honourably and worthily in the ſtrength and comfort of them. Yet it cannot bee denyed but that ſtill the Law Moral is a perfect rule of all perfect Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al righteouſneſſe; and that Chriſt hath expunged no part of it, but commands all, yea writes the righteouſneſſe of all in the hearts of beleevers, that they might will all, and delight to doe all, not onely after the Moral, but after the Evangelical rule, through Chriſt, for whoſe ſake their unperfect ſervices are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God as though they were full and compleat. This hath been cleared before in our examination of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> ſecond Anſwer to the ſeeond Queſtion, and expreſs Scriptures alleadged for confirmation thereof. Neither can wee think that the many infinite benefits freely conferred in the way of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon us, do exempt us from, but are obligations upon us unto the fulfilling of all righteouſneſs: or that it is our bondage, but our liberty to be <hi>free from ſinne, and the ſervants of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The nature of the commands being now altered under the Covenant of Grace, from what they were under the Covenant of workes. Then they proceeded from meer ſoveraignty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, now from tender Grace and Love. Then had they a ſting in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:167891:136"/> the tayle, the curſe and hell to inflict, in caſe there were not full performance. This ſting and curſe is now carried away in the body of Chriſt, no threat of it to them that are in Chriſt, but the thing commanded for the compleating of our perfection, which conſiſts in our conformity with the will and nature of God, with this dammage annexed, that the leſſe perfectly we perform, the father off we are yet from our deſired perfection. There the Lord commanded his ſervants, here the father his dear Children. There man was commanded to work in his own ſtrength, here the treaſury of Chriſt is opened, and the power of his Spirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and we commanded to receive our fill, and in the ſtrength of what we receive, to mount higher and higher untill we come to full perfection.</p>

He ſhould have left to <hi>Socinus</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thus to have argued, who make humane reaſon the rule and bound of their Religion. Had he ſaid, he is not yet convinced, becauſe he yet meets not with any punctual teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that expreſsly affirms it, this would have at the worſt but implyed ſome inadvertency in his reading the Scriptures. But not to deny that the Scripture ſaith it, and yet not to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe he ſeeth not to what ends Chriſt ſhould doe what the Scripture ſaith he hath done; this is no leſſe than the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the authority of his reaſon above the authority of Gods Word: and an attributing of power to his own blindneſſe, of ſilencing and fruſtrating the authority and truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p>But who is more blinde than he that will not ſee?

It ſhall ſo convince men of ſinne, that it ſhall convince them of righteouſneſſe alſo, of damning ſinne in themſelves, and of ſaving righteouſneſſe laid up for them in Chriſt. This the Law could not do; Therefore is as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes (for ſo Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> here takes the Law,) neither the onely, nor the chiefe means ordained of God to convince of ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it makes the Law, upon it old terms, to be ordained of God, in a ſpecial and proper manner to convince of ſinne. This indeed was the office of the Law, as given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon

                        <p>For concluſion he ſaith,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> But I judge the queſtion to be of more difficulty than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                        <p>And I anſwer, that the difficulty of the queſtion is not from the Word of God, but from him and his fellowes, which fill with knots hard to be looſed, the leading thread which Chriſt hath given us all diſplayed. As for the Moment of the queſtion, let him crack at his pleaſure among fooles; yet the wiſe muſt needs ſee and acknowledge it ſuch, as if he loſe it, he loſeth one of his chiefe pillars (though it be but a paper pillar) to bear up mans perſonal righteouſneſſe to juſtification. For if it be proved that Chriſt requireth perfect obedience under the Goſpel, down falls all the perfection, meritoriouſneſſe and efficacy of mans righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to Juſtification. And ſo he muſt begin all again, and fit himſelfe with better pillars next, if any where from <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Jury</hi> they are to be had, this proving rotten and unuſefull. That obedience which in relation to both Covenants, to Law and Goſpel too, is ſinfully unperfect, cannot bee of any power to Juſtifie.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <label>Theſ. 32, 33, 34, 35.</label> UNto this I may ad the <hi>quodlibetarie &amp; quidlibetarie doctrines</hi> of Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> his <hi>Niceties, quiddities,</hi> and nimble nothings, whereof he diſputes profoundly in the four next Theſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the 32 &amp;c. and in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> in anſwer to the third queſtion, pag. 12. of the appendix, and thence to pag. 27. in which many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and rare ſpeculations are unfolded. <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether the rope wherewith <hi>Judas</hi> hanged himſelfe, were made of hair or hemp?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether it were <hi>Simon, alias</hi> called <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Peter, alias</hi> called <hi>Simon,</hi> that denyed Chriſt; and whether it were <hi>Pontius,</hi> or elſe <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether it were Chriſts Croſſe, or elſe the Croſſe of Chriſt that <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was compelled to bear? Item whether hee carried it on his right or his left ſhoulder? and which end of the Croſſe was before, and whether the contrary end were behind in carriage?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whether when <hi>Joab</hi> was put to death for killing two men, <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> for which of theſe two murthers he ſuffered, for the former or the latter, or for neither?</p>
                        <p>The ſame or like to theſe are the diſputes of Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> in theſe Theſes and their explications, and in the forementioned part of the Appendix. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Whether, when himſelfe hath laid it down for a poſition no leſſe firm and unrepealable than the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> which alter not, that there is no ſinne prohibited in the Goſpel, which is not a breach of ſome precept of the Decalogue, and a ſinne againſt the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, &amp;c. Yet nevertheleſſe there be any ſinnes againſt the New Covenant which are not alſo againſt the Old Item whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſinnes, conſiderable in any of their reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel onely, and not againſt the Moral Law? and then conſequently, whether Chriſt hath ſatisfied by his death for ſuch ſinnes as himſelf affirmes never have been, never ſhall be, or can be committed. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 30. pag. 148. that is, for imaginary
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:167891:139"/> ſins which never were ſins, nor ſhall be? <hi>Theſ.</hi> 32.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When he hath aſſerted, and peremptorily concluded, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 32. That Chriſt was not to ſatisfie for any ſin committed againſt the New Covenant, which was not, is not alſo a ſin againſt the Old: Yet whether it be not very needfull to be queſtioned in the 33. Theſ. Whether Chriſt hath done, what he was not to doe? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath ſatisfied for ſins that violated the New Covenant, as well as for thoſe that violate the Old Covenant? And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if he ſhould have ſo done, whether this were to have been reckoned as a work of ſupererogation above, and beyond his duty, to have merited ſuperexcedently for us; or an act of ſin againſt his duty, putting him into an incapacity to merit at all for us? yea whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> concludeth abſolutely as an undeniable truth, <hi>Theſ. 32. Therefore Chriſt dyed not for any ſin againſt the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace,</hi> whether that be not a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove in <hi>Theſ.</hi> 33. that Chriſt hath not by his paſſive obedience ſatisfied for the ſinnes that violate the Covenant of Grace? who can evade the force of ſuch an argument, Chriſt hath not ſatisfied, <hi>ergo</hi> he hath not ſatisfied; ſpecially when it hath been before proved in words at length, that there is no ſin againſt the New Covenant, but is a ſin againſt the Old alſo; and it is ſatisfied for, as to the Old Covenant, what reaſon is there then that it ſhould bee ſatisfied, as to the New Covenant too? When the Creditor is payd his full debt in the hall, and hath yeelded up the bond, will he expect to have the ſame debt payd to him in the parlor alſo?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether, when both Law and Goſpel, Old, and New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, command the ſame thing; that Chriſt then ſatisfyeth for the breach of that duty, as to the Law, but not as to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? The Goſpel then damneth men for that fault that in reference to the Law is ſatisfied for? and conſequently many poor wretches are damned by the Goſpel, and New Covenant, which by the Law, and Old Covenant ſhould be ſaved? Or if it be not ſo, whether then it be not the Law that damneth even fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall unbelief it ſelf, taking advantage from the violating of the grace of the New Covenant, to aggravate their condemnation, that under the means of Grace have lived, and dyed contemners thereof?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whether all other ſinnes which the Goſpel precepts do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, be againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, as the object of thoſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:167891:139"/> ſins, onely the breaking of the conditions of the Goſpel, be not a ſin againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, as the object of that ſin? for ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pag. 159. diſtinguiſheth between thoſe ſinnes that have Chriſt, and the Goſpel for their object, and thoſe breaches of the conditions of the New Covenant, as if theſe had not Chriſt and his Goſpel for their object. What then is the object of theſe ſins? or have they no object? or how many thouſand conditions of the New Covenant are there, the breach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is by no ſacrifice to be purged? Hee tells us indeed, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 32. pag. 159. <hi>that the Goſpel threatneth death to no other ſin, but final unbelief and rebellion.</hi> But this finall unbelief, and finall rebellion hath its belly ſo full of other ſmall ſins threatned in the womb of their Mother, [<hi>Rebellion</hi>] as ever a man found of the berries in the belly of a breeding Lobſter. And in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, pag. 23. he makes finall unbelief the <hi>genus,</hi> to which he attributes but three ſpecies, of which the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordinary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall unbelief, is not to bee conſidered as <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſima,</hi> but <hi>ſubalterna,</hi> which being looked upon as a <hi>genus,</hi> hath ſo many <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or as a <hi>ſpecies</hi> hath ſo many <hi>individuals</hi> under it (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrine) as the beſt Arithmetician in the world, ſaving himſelfe, will not dare to yeeld up, upon his caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the true ſumme of them to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> cenſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as it will appear when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> comes to unlace, and rip abroad his Juſtifying Faith in its largeſt ſenſe. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 70.</p>
                        <p>To theſe I might adde many more quaintiſies of the ſame nature, breathing out themſelves from the veins of this his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But all the reſt, as thoſe already mentioned, are but tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irons to take up the time of men that are <hi>Malè feriati,</hi> rather love to play with the buttons, then to cloſe with the body, and drink in the ſpirit of true Chriſtianity. And what other end can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have in theſe his chippings and mincings, but to ſhew the delicacy of his wit? Whom hath he in the ſubſtance of what he ſpeaketh, his adverſary? We grant and teach with him.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is no ſin prohibited by the Goſpel, or New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is not a ſin againſt the Law, and Old Covenant alſo.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That finall unbelief, and rebellion, are ſins (if not unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable) as if they exceeded the bounds of Gods grace, and Chriſts merits to pardon them, yet) which have no futurition of pardon, ſhall never be pardoned in this life, or in that which is to come: For ſo hath the Lord declared his purpoſe in reference to theſe ſins.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:167891:140"/>3. That both the Law and the Goſpel concurre in damning ſuch perſons; the Law as a Covenant of Workes properly, for their refuſall to ſubmit (even till death it ſelf) to the will and authority of God, requiring Faith in Chriſt for their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from vengeance. The Goſpel improperly, by withholding its ſhelter from the Laws ſentence againſt them, becauſe they would never be perſwaded to come under the ſhelter of it: yea more in ſtrengthning the hand of the Law to give them the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer puniſhment, for the contempt of Gods grace, as well as of his Authority and Juſtice. And thus not onely the mountains of their ſinnes againſt the Law, but alſo Chriſt the Rock ſhall fall upon them to their greater ſhivering, for that they dared to daſh themſelves againſt him, and would not be induced to be built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the ſtroakes of vengeance upon him.</p>
                        <p>This is the ſumme of all that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſaies. To what purpoſe then are his elaborate diſtinctions of the differing reſpects and aſpects, ſenſes and non-ſenſes, in which Chriſt hath either ſatisfied, or not ſatisfied for mans ſins, unleſſe it be <hi>Balaam</hi>-like, to lay a ſtumbling block in the way of the ſimpler people of Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to occaſion their fall? to puzzle their judgements and conſciences? and to make the way of grace, which is in it ſelf as diſcovered by the Lord Chriſt, eaſie and plaine, to be unto them by his evill working therein, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, perplexed, and full of ſnares? To all ſober men it ſufficeth to know,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is no one of their ſins, in whatſoever conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it be taken, but hath death and hell in the tayl of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That there cannot be any other way of exemption from the death &amp; hel which every ſuch ſin of theirs meriteth, by any other meanes but by the redemption which is by, and in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the blood of Chriſt hath in it a perfect efficacy to cleanſe from all ſin whatſoever, no one excepted, if it be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cleanſe; Not the very ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which it hath not power totally to purge out from the conſcience, if it were truly applyed. But therefore is that ſin never pardoned, and purged from the ſoul, becauſe the Spirit of God never doth, nor will apply the blood of Chriſt to the ſoul that is guilty of it; nor generates Faith in ſuch a ſoul to run unto, and waſh in the Fountain of Chriſts blood, that it may be clean. Let there be any
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:167891:140"/> one ſin named of all the ſins whereof our corrupt nature is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is ſo much a ſin againſt the Goſpel, but that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or not purging away of it, the abſolving of the conſcience from it, or retaining of it upon the conſcience, doth not wholly depend upon the application, or not application of the blood of Chriſt to the ſoul, and I ſhall acknowledge that I have ſeen but the Letter, and was never yet acquainted with the Spirit, and drift of the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>Or ſuppoſe we ſhould take a delight to contend about that which is a meer <hi>lana caprina,</hi> whether it be hair or wooll that grows upon the Goats ſhoulders, how feeble might we manifeſt the reaſons to be which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> beingeth to prove, that the ſins againſt the New Covenant are not ſatisfied for, by the ſacrifice of Chriſts death.</p>
                        <p>As 1. When the Apoſtle affirmeth <hi>Chriſt to have ſuffered death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. Doth it follow thence that he hath not redeemed from the tranſgreſſions againſt the New Covenant alſo? If I ſay that Chriſt forgave to <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> all their ſins committed before converſion, do I thereby as much as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that he retains ſtill, and revengeth upon them all the ſinnes they committed after they were converted? Or ſhould one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> acquaintance ſay, that whatſoever Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> preached, and wrote, untill four or five years ſince, was good, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, doth it follow that all that he hath ſince preached, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is heretical, and erroneous? Nay the purpoſe of the Apoſtle here is to convince the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that ſought in part for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the Law, or Old Teſtament, that it could not make its obſervers perfect: For Chriſt dyed to redeem the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them that were under the firſt Covenant, which he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have done, if all the Sacrifices under the Law could have purged them. And thus the Morall Law is not here at all oppoſed to the Goſpel, that the Goſpel, or New Covenant doe purge the ſinnes onely that were committed under, and againſt the Morall Law, becauſe all the righteouſneſſe of the Morall Law could not purge them; but the ſacrifice of Chriſt, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant, is here oppoſed to the Leviticall ſacrifices under the Legall Covenant. What theſe could not, the ſacrifice of Chriſt hath expiated.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Where he tels us, that <hi>Chriſt could not ſatisfie for ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:167891:141"/> againſt the New Covenant, becauſe the New Covenant threatens no death to ſuch ſinnes, therefore no need if Chriſts mediating death here for us: For where no death is threatned, there is none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely due,</hi> ſaith he. But will he ſay none is either explicitely, or implicitely due? Or when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tels us pag. 15. that in the Old Covenant <hi>the promiſe of life is not expreſſed, but plainly implyed in the threatning of death:</hi> Will it not follow by the ſame reaſons, that when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the after part of this his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate alleageth ſuch multitudes of Scriptures, that promiſe life to the performance of ſuch and ſuch acts of Goſpel righteouſneſſe, that there is implyed the threat of death againſt the non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame? Or if it ſhould have been printed (as it is moſt probable, becauſe he ſo ſpeaketh elſwhere in reference to the covenants) that where death is not explicitely threatned, there it is not due, and Chriſt hath not ſuffered it in our behalfe. What ſhall we think then of all the fathers from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes?</hi> where was this death explicitely threatned to any actual ſinne, untill the Law was given by <hi>Moſes?</hi> The Scripture mentions it not, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath told us (though I doubt ſomewhat raſhly, and Magiſterially) that <hi>to Adam himſelf in his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the form of the Covenant was not known</hi> (as written in his heart) <hi>but by ſuperadded revelation,</hi> pag. 14. Yea what ſhall we ſay of all the Nations of the world (<hi>Iſrael</hi> alone excepted) that even untill Chriſt, had no revealed Covenant with God, much leſſe death threatned explicitely by ſuch a Covenant? Will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> deny death to have been due to them for their ſinnes, becauſe not explicitely threatned? Doth not the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 1. 32. &amp; alibi,</hi> affirm the contrary? Thus if it were; but it is not proved, that the New Teſtament doth not ſo threaten death.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When he tels us that <hi>Chriſt is ſaid to have been made under the Law, and to have born the curſe of the Law, and to have freed us from it, but no where is this affirmed of him, in reſpect of the Goſpel,</hi> pag. 161. This is an Argument of the ſame nature, with that before, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. The Apoſtle to daſh the creſt of their ſelf-confidence, in ſeeking to be in part ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alſo doth) by their own perſonall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe done in conformity to the Law, tels them that even the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that were priviledged above all other people with a Law of Righteouſneſs, were under the curſe of the Law, and could not be ſaved but by a Redeemer; much leſs they that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:167891:141"/> had not the help of ſuch a Law. It bears the ſame ſenſe with that of <hi>Gal. 2. 15, 16. We that are Jews by nature, and not ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s of the Gentiles, Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt that we may be juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> What a monſtrous deluſion were it then for us to teach the ſinners of the Gentiles to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juſtification by their perſonal righteouſneſs, according to the Law. And though it be no where, <hi>totidem verbis, ſaid, or affirmed of him in reſpect of the Goſpel,</hi> yet is it ſaid in the words equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 15. That he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament: whence <hi>Pareus</hi> on the place concludeth, <hi>That if he hath ſatisfied for the ſins againſt the Old, much more for the ſinnes againſt the New Teſtament, ſeeing he is the Mediator of this, not of that. And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>Ergo</hi> from ſins alſo againſt the Goſpel. I cannot ſay from ſinns which are onely againſt the Goſpel, for there are none ſuch. Or if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will take the words ſo ſtrictly as hee ſeems to take them, that Chriſt hath redeemed onely from ſins againſt the Law, hee muſt exclude himſelf, with all the Churches and Saints of the Gentiles that are, or have been, from the redemption which is by Chriſt; for ſo then muſt that paſſage in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. be read; <hi>Chriſt was made under the Law to redeem them [onely] that were under the Law. i. e.</hi> Only the Jews, for they onely were under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of this Law Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt needs confeſs the Apoſtle here to ſpeak. So that this argument of his, if it pleaſe not a Jew, it will pleaſe no body.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The laſt Argument which he brings in the ſame 161 pag. to hit the white, and cleave the pin, and reſolve the queſtion ſo unanſwerably, that no tongue which cannot ſpeak may ever more utter, or mutter againſt it, is as ſtreight with his purpoſe, as a rams horn with a line. 4. <hi>But the queſtion is out of doubt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe that every man that performeth not the Goſpel-conditions, doth bear the puniſhment himſelf in eternall fire, and therefore Chriſt did not bear it.</hi> True, for Chriſt did bear the puniſhment of none of his ſins, neither of his lying, ſwearing, luſt, murther, drunkenneſſe, and other ſins againſt the Law, but he ſhall bear all himſelf: ſhall we therefore conclude that Chriſt dyed not to make ſatisfaction for thoſe ſinnes in reference to them that have part in his death? This were to pronounce Chriſt to have ſatisfied for no ſin at all, either againſt Law or Goſpel, and ſo no fleſh ſhall be ſaved, but ll ſuffer in eternal fire.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="226" facs="tcp:167891:142"/>5. What is in this Argument, as alſo in the two next, and immediately put before this, in the ſame 161 pag. of his Saint-conditions which he worſhipeth as his Mediators to bring him into communion with Chriſt, no leſs then he doth Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bring him into communion with God, I have partly ſpoken to before, and ſhall have large, and frequent occaſions to ſpeak more fully and largely upon other parts of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> here he doth but name conditions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and what he ſaith is not worthy of any particular Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions in relation to it.</p>
                        <p>He confeſſeth himſelf pag. 160. <hi>To have been long of another judgement in this point, while he conſidered not the tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants diſtinctly:</hi> That is, as long as he derived his guidance therein from the Scripture it ſelf, and from the truly Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Orthodox Commentators thereon.

As there he cannot cloſe with Mr. <hi>Burgeſs, That Juſtification, beſides the pardon of ſin, doth connote a State that the ſubject is put into,</hi> viz. <hi>a ſtate of favour, being reconciled with God. Becauſe remiſſion it ſelf doth connote the ſtate of favour. For if the loſſe of Gods favour be a part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and all the puniſhment be remitted, then the favour which was loſt, muſt needs be thereby reſtored.</hi> So neither ſhould I have eaſily cloſed with another, putting Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> plain difference, pag. 186, between Remiſſion, and Juſtification, in their ſaid <hi>terminis,</hi> that the one delivers from obligation to puniſhment, the other from the Laws accuſation, and condemnation. Becauſe freedom from obligation to puniſhment doth connote freedome from the Laws accuſation, and condemnation; and freedome from the Laws accuſation, and condemnation connotes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from obligation to puniſhment; and ſo doth Remiſſion of ſinnes, and Juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtification in Romane, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in Secretary hand, have the ſame <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> viz. The Laws accuſation, and condemnation, and obligation to puniſhment; and conſequently that they are one and the ſame thing. But let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> paſs in this particle without further interruption. It is not for that he ſees a difference, but that hee thinkes it will ſomewhat advantage him in attaining the ends to which he driveth, to make an imaginary difference between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſinne, and Juſtification <hi>in terminis.</hi> Therefore doth he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo acutely diſtinguiſh.

                        <p n="2">2. Neither doe I account it worthy of any deep examination, what in the Explication of the firſt words of the Definition, that it is [<hi>an Act of God</hi>] hee doth pag. 168. trifle about the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he maketh between Chriſts Acceptance, Pardon, and Kingdome, and Gods Acceptance, Pardon, and Kingdome. We grant unto him, that as of the two Temples that <hi>Marcellus</hi> built at <hi>Rome,</hi> one dedicated to <hi>Virtue,</hi> the other to <hi>Honour;</hi> that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:167891:143"/> to <hi>Honour</hi> had no door to it, but out of the Temple of <hi>Virtue:</hi> So neither is there any other entrance into the Kingdome of Glory, but thorough the Kingdome of Grace. But to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Chriſts, and Gods Acceptance, Pardon, and Kingdom, as if the one were upon Earth, the other not untill we are tranſlated hence into Heaven, and ſo we muſt be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven firſt, and bee forgiven afterwards; or as if Chriſts accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not Gods, or the Fathers Acceptance, Pardon, and Kingdom, is a meerly imaginary dreame of one that liſteth to dream waking; pat indeed to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> purpoſe of ſetting up his two-fold, or rather manifold Juſtifications; but wholly thwarting and croſſing the Scriptures, which affirme, Not that Chriſt as Mediator reconciled the world to himſelf, but <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them. 2.

And more often call the Kingdom of Grace here, <hi>the Kingdome of God, then the Kingdome of Chriſt.</hi> And that the great Abſolution at laſt in the day of Judgement ſhall be given by Chriſt, and not by the Father in perſon, and the ſame not in Heaven, but before the Aſcenſion of the Saints into Heaven, as is evident by all the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which deſcribe the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day.

A meer vanity of words, without either ground, or ſubſtance. It doth not alway hold firm in trifling debts of money. Suppoſe I have a ſonne, that having received his portion of my eſtate from me, will forthwith come and pay it me for the debt of ſome bankrupt debtor, that I have caſt into priſon; if indeed it be ſo agreed upon between my ſelf,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:167891:144"/> and my ſaid Sonne; and that to this end I gave him ſuch a portion of my eſtate, that he ſhould ſo doe with it, then it were not equity in me to refuſe the payment ſo offered. But yet Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> wil not deny that this agreement, or covenant between me, and my ſonne, and my receiving of my own monyes in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for that Bankrupts debt, though it be the ſame, to the utmoſt farthing which hee owed, is an act of grace, or favour in mee to the ſaid Debtor.

What is there in this caſe binding me to receive the debt from ſuch an hand, or to give an acquittance to him that ſhould pay it? Much leſſe will the caſe hold in point of Life and Death. Suppoſe ſome Prieſt, Jeſuit, or other Traytor were by the Law condemned to dye for Treaſon committed: The day of Execution is at hand, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> interpoſes, and offereth to dye for him: Is it not in the power of the chiefe Magiſtrates to refuſe the accepting of the death of the Innocent for the Nocent? Or if they doe accept the change, is it not an Act of free grace to pardon the offendor, accepting anothers ſufferings for him? Much more is it a gracious act in God to pardon us upon Chriſts ſuffering in our ſtead, becauſe hee ſent his Sonne, and <hi>gave him a body wherein to ſuffer for us,</hi> Heb. 10. 5. And gives us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, having caſt him into priſon in our behalf, untill he had payd the utmoſt farthing of our debts.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What hee ſaith againſt the ignorant Antinomians in the end of page 169, and in page 170, hee hath ſayd before, and it hath been before examined, and his pepper-corne being cruſhed, hath been found too hot in ſmell and operation, for a humble, and ſelfe-denying Chriſtian to meddle with in the point of Juſtification. Therefore I conclude with him, nor further to trouble the Reader with thoſe ſenſleſs conceites which have onely a plauſible ſhew of words, but no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scriptures, or authority from Scriptures to eſtabliſh them.</p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:167891:144"/>
                        <p>The reſt of the Doctrine which hee delivereth in this page 170, and addeth page 171, and 172, I doe in part grant him; and what I grant him not, wee ſhall finde againe ſo involved in his diſpute, whether Juſtification bee an immanent, or tranſient Act of God, page 173, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> that it ſhall be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there then here to take it into examination.</p>
                        <p>In his 173 page, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> enters upon a diſpute of great moment, whether Remiſſion and Juſtification be imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or tranſient Acts of God? Before pag. 93 of this Tractate, in <hi>a brave challenge of the Antinomians to produce one Scripture, teſtifying Juſtification to be from eternity, hee promiſed to ſhew, or prove that Juſtification is not an immanent Act in God.</hi> Here he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to the accompliſhment of what he there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in doing it he pretendedly draws the ſword againſt the Antinomians, as the ſole aſſertors of the opinion which he here with much gallantry ſeeks to confute.</p>
                        <p>Two things then I conceive here to call for examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, how ſound the reaſons are which he brings to deny Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Juſtification to be immanent, and to prove them to bee meerly tranſient acts of God.</p>
                        <p>2. What kind of Vermine theſe Antinomians are, againſt whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath already diſcharged ſo many Gun-ſhots before in this Treatiſe, and findes them nevertheleſs yet alive, and in a capacity to bear ſo many more ſhots from him, in this, and the following parts of this book.</p>
                        <p>Before my entrance upon either of theſe, for an introduction to the former, that the ſtate of the queſtion may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I ſhall endeavour with as much fidelity, and ſimplicity as (in briefe) I may, to lay downe the judgements of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, whom he ſlanders here, and every where (almoſt) with Antinomianiſm, about this queſtion, before mentioned, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here ſo much oppoſeth, I mean ſuch of theſe as hold (not that all have taught it) to be in ſome reſpect immanent in God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Then, in their diſputes againſt <hi>Bellarmine, Arminius, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and their followers, about remiſſion of ſinnes, and juſtification they tell us, that juſtification is taken ſometimes actively, for a judicial act of Gods grace; ſometimes paſſively, or terminatively; as it hath its termination upon beleevers. In the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:167891:145"/> former ſenſe, it is an act internal and immanent in God, not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient upon an extraneous ſubject; or in plain words, it is ſecret, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, and hidden in God himſelfe, not declared or paſſing into the knowledg and conſcience of man. That it is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the acts of election and reprobation, having its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete being, as theſe, before the perſons ſo elected, juſtified and reprobated, begin to have being, life or faith in them, or to doe good or evill. But in its paſſive ſenſe, as it is terminated upon, and made out to the conſcience of a man, ſo it is a tranſient act of God, pronouncing and declaring home to the conſcience of a man now living, convinced of his ſinnes, and trembling at the ſenſe and burthen thereof, yet reſting upon, and cleaving to Chriſt by faith; that his ſinnes are forgiven for Chriſts ſake; and by this act and ſentence of God in his conſcience the poor ſinner becomes ſenſible and apprehenſive of his full diſcharge and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution at Gods tribunal, thorow Chriſts ſatisfaction made to juſtice for him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That juſtification, as taken in the former ſenſe, is an Act of Gods ſupreme Lordſhip or dominion, or elſe of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (to uſe the Apoſtles termes) by which he freely and without neceſſity, in relation to his juſtice, willeth the ſalvation of one, and willeth not the ſalvation of another, loveth or hateth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not, or doth impute ſinne, according to his own free will. But juſtification in the latter ſenſe, is an act of Gods righteouſnes or faithfulneſſe, by which hee faithfully and righteouſly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth his promiſes of grace, in juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ying and abſolving them which believe, by the ſentence of pardon pronounced to their conſcience, according to the Goſpel promiſe made to beleevers. No word of promiſe went before juſtification in the former ſenſe, to make it an act of juſtice to fulfill that promiſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it be an act of his natural juſtice, that by the neceſſity of his nature he ſhould ſo juſtifie and love any; for then ſhould none be either loved or ſaved freely of God, when contrariwiſe it was in his own free choice, to love or to hate, to ſave or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all, or <hi>mutatis vicibus,</hi> to have loved <hi>Eſau,</hi> &amp; hated <hi>Jacob,</hi> to have willed the condemnation of the ſaved, and the ſalvation of the reprobated. But the word of promiſe preceded juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the latter ſenſe, which it is righteouſneſſe in God to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill; therefore is it an act as well of his juſtice or righteouſneſſe, as of his free grace.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="233" facs="tcp:167891:145"/>3. That Juſtification in the former ſenſe is antecedaneous, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going to all covenants whatſoever. 1. In order of nature (though not in time) it goeth before that covenant between the father and the ſon, mentioned before in the examination of the explication of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> fourteenth <hi>Theſis;</hi> and conſequently before Chriſts undertaking to make, or the fathers Covenant to accept what he ſhould offer, in ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the elect. For in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature the willing of the end, alway goeth before the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the means conducing to the end; ſo that Gods willing mans righteouſneſſe and immunity from ſinne, and loving him to ſalvation, muſt needs goe before his willing of Chriſts ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his juſtice, which was but a mean appointed of God to the conſtituting of man righteous before him, that he might be pure from ſinne, diſcharged from condemnation, and partaker of ſalvation, which was the end. Not that there was any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, or following after, of theſe acts of God, in time: for they are both coeternal, and before all times. Whom God hath loved, and forgiven their ſinnes, them hath he ſo loved and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, in and through Chriſt from all eternity, and through and for the merit of his ſatisfaction. Much more doth this imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent act of juſtification go before, not onely in nature, but in time alſo, the other temporary Covenants, both the Covenant of workes made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Goſpel promiſe, by Chriſt, or God in Chriſt, to us and with us. For theſe had all their being in time. But juſtification in its other acceptation is ſubſequent unto, and followes after, and is an effect of not onely the Covenant of Grace, but of faith it ſelfe, which the Covenant of Grace calls for, as a mean to attain it. None elſe but a beleiver, nor he, until he actually beleeveth, is thus actually juſtified, or hath pardon of ſinnes and abſolution from wrath declared and pronounced of God in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And thus to be juſtified in Chriſt, or in God, is one thing and to bee juſtified in our ſelves by God through Chriſt is another. The former is an antecedent, the latter an effect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That neither the mediation &amp; ſatisfaction of Chriſt, nor (much leſſe) our faith in Chriſt, nor any of the moſt noble gifts of grace received from Chriſt, either in their habit or operation do move God to juſtifie us, ſo as to put into him a will to pardon our ſins, and accept us as righteous, or to change his affection from nilling
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:167891:146"/> to will our forgiveneſſe and happineſſe, and from hating to love and accept us; becauſe he is God, and therefore immutable; and there cannot be any cauſe of Gods will rendred, any more than of God himſelfe. For the Will of God, is God himſelfe, and theſe immanent acts of God, are God himſelfe acting. So that the ſubſtration of all that Chriſt hath ſuffered, and by his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings ſatisfied for us, and of all that we doe, or can doe to put our ſelves into union with Chriſt, and a conformity with the Will of God, are in no wiſe the cauſes or conditions, or antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Gods firſt loving, owning, and pronouncing u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pure from ſinne imputed; but the effects thereof. For he ſo loveth and juſtifieth all, that in a Covenant way have been, or ſhall be juſtified in their own conſcience, before ever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or live. But that the intervening of Chriſts ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, and our recumbency upon, and embracing of Chriſt ſo ſatisfying by faith, that we may be juſtified, do ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God which was not, nor alter any thing which was in his will before; but do onely lay and make a way by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how he from all eternity loving and juſtifying us in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe freely, may in a courſe moſt convenient to magnify both his truth and righteouſneſſe, and withal his grace and mercy, at length actually declare us juſt in, and to our own conſciences, and for ever acquit us from ſinne and wrath, to the admiration of Men and Angels. And ſo the former juſtification is a pure, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, free, and irreſpective act of God, having no cauſality out of himſelfe moving him to it: but the latter is a foederal, Goſpel or Covenant juſtification, reſpecting his own Covenant before made, Chriſts ſatisfaction already given and pleaded in heaven by Chriſt, and mans faith in the mediator and promiſer, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe, and the blood of the mediator ſealing it: upon all which he doth, he cannot but actually pronounce and declare to the conſcience of the beleiver his perfect abſolution from ſin and vengeance. This latter is indeed the juſtifying wherof the Scriptures primarily ſpeak, as oft as they ſpeak of juſtification by faith, but ſo as the former is alſo in ſuch Scriptures implyed. Neither is the Scripture ſilent in reference to the former, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without the latter, or apart from it.</p>

Therefore as if there had been no Chriſt, no Mediator and reconciler, no Covenant of Grace, yea no Grace, or acts of Grace eternal or temporary in God thorow Chriſt, ſo he remained under a Spirit either of deluſion or of bondage ſtill. But now when the father hath drawn him to Chriſt, and Chriſt hath received him, when Chriſt hath appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him to himſelfe by his Spirit, and he by faith hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Chriſt to himſelfe for redemption, reconciliation, remiſſion, righteouſneſſe, and whatſoever elſe is laid up in Chriſt for him; and ſo hath union and communion with Chriſt, hath Chriſt in him, and is himſelfe in Chriſt: Now his juſtification, which was ſure before in God and in Chriſt, is alſo made ſure to his conſcience.

Elſe if he ſhould have born the leaſt ſtroke of Gods revenging juſtice, and in the leaſt pittance have made but one leaſt peece of ſatisfaction by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for his offences; then either Chriſt hath made ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him but in part; and is not his whole Saviour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for that himſelfe hath ſatisfied divine juſtice in part: or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the father hath taken ſatisfaction twice for the ſame ſins, once from the Lord Chriſt, and after that from the offender al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But this were to ſlander either the perfection of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, or the incorruptneſſe of Gods juſtice, both which are unſufferable.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That the juſtification which is by faith conſiſteth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a bare apprehenſion of our juſtification and pardon from God, (for this is onely mans act, and no expreſs act of God) but firſt in Gods actual declaration, evidencing and certisfying the conſcience of man drawn to the barre of judgement (ſet up as it were in the conſcience) that God hath taken ſatisfaction to his offended juſtice from the Lord Chriſt for all the offenders ſinnes, and hath for ever quit-claimed and diſcharged him from all ſin and wrath, and admitted him into favour and family to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpenſations of his grace for ever. And then indeed God having by this act abſolved the conſcience, there followeth alſo the ſenſe of our remiſſion and juſtification: So that beſides this ſenſe and apprehenſion, there are two things in our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:167891:148"/> by faith over and above that which was in our eternal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in Chriſt: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A total diffidence and denyal of our own righteouſneſſe, and a truſting and adhering wholly and onely to Chriſt for pardon and juſtification. 2. Gods act upon our conſciences, declaring and aſſuring us that our debt is paid by Chriſt, and we diſcharged upon the ſatisfaction which our ſurety hath made, ſo that the obligation is cancelled, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with a full and general acquittance in our conſciences. Neither of theſe were there in the former juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the juſtification in the former ſenſe before mentioned, and ſo that there is more than the bare knowledge of our juſtification, in our being juſtified in the latter ſenſe is evident.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever elſe is conteined in the doctrine of the Proteſtant divines about this queſtion, we ſhall have occaſion to adde in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining what Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith here, and afterwards to oppugn it.</p>
                        <p>But the chief thing is yet behind, (may ſome ſay) <hi>viz.</hi> the proof of theſe poſitions by ſound Arguments, or by evidencing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and the main thing to be proved, is, that there is ſuch a juſtification as is an immanent and eternal act in God. It is Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> lowd challenge. pag. 93. <hi>Let all the</hi> Antinomians <hi>ſhew but one Scripture that ſpeaketh of juſtification from eternity.</hi> I will be ſo charitable as to conceive, he expects not that we ſhould produce Scriptures that ſay in thoſe very words, but that which is the <hi>Tantundem</hi>) that ſay it in ſenſe and ſubſtance; elſe if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the matter, and ſtick to words, I ſhall challenge him to produce one ſentence of all the ſermons which Chriſt preached, and in the whole doctrine that he perſonally delivered, which ſpeaketh at all of juſtification by faith. But in words equipollent to Maſter <hi>Baxters,</hi> the Scripture delivereth this doctrine which he oppoſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> juſtification from eternity.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What leſſe is to be gathered from 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. God hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt, before the World began.</hi> What can be ſaid more fully to Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> challenge? He will not deny that the word ſaving, doth include in it juſtifying, for ſo ſhould he both contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and loſe elſwhere more than he can gain here, by denying it. It will then run thus, that we are juſtified and called of God with a holy calling, not according to our works, [theſe words
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:167891:148"/> deſtroy the end of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> oppoſing the eternity of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification] if our own qualifycation and workes may not come in collaterally with Chriſt to conſtitute us juſtified, he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards whether the act be immanent or tranſient) but according to his purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt, before the world began, and that is from eternity. See, the grace of juſtification and ſalvation was given us in Chriſt from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> may probably object, that the grace was indeed given us in Chriſt from eternity, that is, God had decreed from eternity to juſtifie us in Chriſt, when we ſhould come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, to juſtifie or ſave us in time, as to call us in time. For the grace here mentioned given us in Chriſt before times, is as much affirmed to be the grace of our vocation or calling, as of our ſaving and juſtifying. But our calling muſt, therefore our juſtification alſo muſt be in time. And thus by the grace given, muſt be underſtood Gods gracious purpoſe, and decree to give us ſalvation and juſtification. So Mr. <hi>Baxter, I know God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to juſtifie his people from eternity. But it is done in time,</hi> page 93.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. That Covenant juſtifying, or the declaring of us in our own Conſciences to bee accepted as juſt in Chriſt, is not denyed to be an act accompliſhed in us in time. Nor yet that God decreed from Eternity to declare us in our conſciences Righteous, when wee ſhould beleeve. But the granting of all this nothing advantageth Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> cauſe: For neither doth this Act of God in time terminate upon our conſcience, nor his eternal decree ſo to juſtifie us (beleeving) in our ſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that wee were juſtified in God, and in Chriſt from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It appears not that the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of our calling to the participation of Chriſt, and of juſtification and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by him in time, but rather of that calling mentioned <hi>Rom. 4. 17. That God calleth thoſe things that be not, as though they were.</hi> As he called <hi>Abraham the father of many Nations,</hi> when he was yet either childleſſe, or at leaſt was in reference to the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without having, without hope to have that child from whom thoſe nations ſhould iſſue and accrew to him as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So God is ſaid to have called us with a holy calling, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have called and reputed us in Chriſt his pardoned, accepted
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:167891:149"/> and adopted children, even before we had any actual being in our ſelves. <hi>Dedit qui erat, accepit qui non erat. Quis antem hoc facere potuit, niſi qui vocat ea quae non ſunt tanquam ea quae ſunt. Aug. de verb. Apoſt. Sect.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. If by Calling it be pertinaciouſly maintained that we muſt underſtand that which is done by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; yet all this helps not Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> at all, in regard of the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive clauſe following, not according to our work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, where our ſalvation and juſtification as well as our vocation, are denyed to have any dependance upon our own workes and qualifications, as conditions thereof: And the whole end of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt juſtification as an immanent Act in God, is, becauſe if that be granted, there will be no place for footing our works and qualifications as neceſſarily precedent conditions of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And theſe fall to ground, as well as if we were juſtified without them, though in time, as if wee were juſtified from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But how, and whether we can truly, and properly be ſaid to have received Grace in Chriſt before all worlds, whereby we are ſaved, and juſtified, and yet not to be ſaved, and juſtified in Chriſt before the world was, will come to bee examined in drawing forth the ſenſe of other Scriptures which I ſhall annex. In the interim this remaines unqueſtioned, that although the Apoſtle ſpeak here of Juſtification in our ſelves in time, yet he affirmes it to be according to the Grace given us in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world; ſo it was in Chriſt for us before, though not in our ſelves till we beleeve.</p>
                        <p>Againe when the Scripture ſpeaking of the Sonnes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaith of them, while yet unborn, and conſequently having neither done good nor evill, <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated, Mal. 1. 2, 3. Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 13. And elſwhere pronounceth of men, that when <hi>they lay in their blood, in their nakedneſs then hee made it the time of love, ſayd to them live, ſpread his skirt over them, and covered them, entred into Covenant with them, and made them his,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6, 8. <hi>God of his great love wherewith hee hath loved us, even when we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 4, 5. <hi>God commendeth his love to us that when we were yet ſinners, when enemies, we were juſtified by Chriſts blood, and reconciled to God by his death.</hi> Rom. 5 8, 9, 10. Here it is evident to all men that the love of God juſtifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:167891:149"/> us to himſelf, goeth before our Faith and Workes, was then in its power and operation, when wee were yet ſinners, in all our pollution, enemies, dead in ſinne, therefore without any ſpirituall motion, or operation to our own cleanſing, or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I demand now when this love of God ſo juſtifying us beganne? Not when we beleeved, and firſt obeyed the Goſpel, for it went before, it was then acted toward us when wee were enemies, dead, &amp;c. Or when wee beganne to be ſinners? Then it ſeems our ſinne begat this love in God, and then let the Atheiſts Aphoriſm ſtand as an impregnable Principle, let our ſinne abound, that the grace and love of God may abound. Or was there ever an hatred of us, as a contrary affection in God, before, which is now expelled that love might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in its place? And hath God now changed his hating of us to condemne us, into a love to juſtifie and ſave us? This were to accuſe God of mutableneſs and change. For God is Love, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 8. and the Love of God is God himſelfe loving, and to affirme where wee finde the Love of God at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that there was a time when this Love was not in God, and a time when God beganne to love, is no other but to affirme, that there was a time when God yet was not, and a time when he beganne to bee God, the will of God being God himſelfe; And the volitions, or willings of God, being God himſelf willing: And the acts of Gods Love and Hatred being acts of Gods Will; yea of God himſelfe, and no more ſubject to change (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe immanent in God) then God himſelfe. So that theſe Scriptures which affirme Gods love to us when ſinners, doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm alſo conſequentially his love to us before we were either in being, or juſt, or ſinners, even from eternity.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when the Lord ſaith to his people, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> Jerem. 13. 3. Doth hee not mean a love which is from everlaſting to everlaſting? Or is there a Love of God to everlaſting which was not from everlaſting? Or was it not the Love of accepting, and approbation of them unto Righteouſneſſe and Salvation, whereof hee there ſpeaketh? And when the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us, that the glory of Gods love doth herein ſhine forth, <hi>Not that we loved him, but that he loved us, 1 John</hi> 4. 10. making not our love, or any fruits thereof, the foundation of Gods love to us, but the love of God to us to goe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:167891:150"/> before and prevent our love; is not this a doctrin univerſally true of all the Saints that are or have been, that Gods love to them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and was antecedaneous to their love toward him? if ſo, then conſequently before mans being, as well as before his loving; and if before mans being, then from eternity <hi>was this grace given us, that we were loved of God in Chriſt, to juſtification and ſalvation.</hi> It is that which the Lord Chriſt ſpeaketh, (and that not obſcurely) in his prayer before his paſſion, where having interceded and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſundry bleſſings for his Elect, he adds this reaſon why he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thoſe bleſſings in their behalfe, viz. <hi>That the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and that thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me. Jo.</hi> 17. 23. How is that? in the next verſe he explaineth himſelf thus, <hi>Thou haſt loved me before the foundation of the world:</hi> what doth follow hence, but that as Chriſt, ſo they that are Chriſts, were loved of God unto life, before the foundation of the world? why will not Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> acknowledge what Chriſt hath prayed that all the world may know?</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Or will it be objected, that God loving the Elect in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, is to be underſtood one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſenſe, that before the foundation of the world, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in himſelfe to love them in Chriſt afterward in time? Then muſt we ſo conclude of Chriſt alſo, that God loved Chriſt before, that is, decreed before the foundation of the world to love Chriſt in after time, not that he loved him from eternity, for as hee loved Chriſt, ſo he loved them in Chriſt: But he actually loved Chriſt as the head of the Church before the foundation of the World, therefore alſo he loved the Elect in Chriſt as the body and members of Chriſt before the foundation of the world. Yea to decree from eternity, to love them afterward in time, and untill the time came, to hate them, or not to love them in Chriſt, was to decree mutableneſſe and change in his own will, <hi>i. e.</hi> in himſelfe, which is wholly repugnant to his nature that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change, by receiving augmentation unto, or diminution of the acts of his Will, which were in him from eternity.</p>

To what time ſhall we reduce this imputation to find it in its Originall, if not to Eternity? When began God to account or reckon us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Chriſt, or not to impute ſinne to us, if he did not actually
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:167891:151"/> doe it in himſelf before time from eternity? When elſe was the generation of the Elect reckoned righteous in Chriſt firſt, and had their iniquity no more imputed; but when Chriſts ſatisfaction became effectuall for them? But this Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> before, page 23, 24. acknowledgeth, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be when Chriſt undertooke to ſatisfie in their behalf: How ſhould it be otherwiſe? when Chriſt came to bee volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily bound for them, then were they diſmiſſed free. <hi>When he became ſinne for them, they became the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. At once their ſinnes were imputed to Chriſt in point of ſatisfaction to bee made for them; and they diſcharged for ever, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Court where theſe things were tranſacted between the Father and the Sonne) from making ſatisfaction in their own perſons, and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly righteous for ever, in reſpect of vengeance, and condemnation for ſinne. But Chriſts undertaking to ſatisfie for them, and conſequently the whole tranſaction, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between the Father and him about our Redemption, and Juſtification, and the ſaid imputation of the ſins of the Elect to Chriſt, were all from eternity, before the foundation of the world, elſe how could they bee loved in Chriſt before the foundation of the world? Therefore alſo their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Righteous in Chriſt, the not imputation of ſinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, their abſolution, and diſcharge from condemnation (and this Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> will acknowledge to be Juſtification) were perfited in God, and in Chriſt before the foundation of the World. Yea however ſome godly Commentators ſpeak beneath the mind of the Apoſtle, yet his words are plaine, and full, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. 1 Tim. 1. 9. That God hath promiſed eternal life, and given us Grace in Chriſt before the world beganne.</hi> How promiſed? unto Chriſt our head, and to us in him, by that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant between the Father and the Son? And how gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in him, but as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath given us eternall life, and this life is in his Son; viz.</hi> laid up in him for us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be received in time into our ſelves, as we receive Chriſt, according to what followeth, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life, 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 11, 12. And the grace or life that in that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. is ſaid to be given us in Chriſt before times, is yer. 10. affirmed to be brought to light by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:167891:151"/> Chriſt in theſe laſt times; As the former ſeems the Immanent, ſo this the Tranſient Act of Juſtification. Elſe let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> produce any other ſeaſon of ſuch a parley and covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Chriſt ſince the world beganne. He finds this project not to thrive in the hands of his friends the Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, therefore as aſhamed of it, he layes it aſide, not touching it (as far as I can remember) in any part of this his Tractate.</p>
                        <p>As for that giddy and unbottomed deviſe of <hi>Grotius,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> laies down firſt in his own words, Theſ. 15. pag. 92. and then in <hi>Grotius</hi> his words, pag. 94, 95. it hathin its due place received ſo much in anſwer, as I think fit to be given to ſo bold &amp; peremptory an aſſertion as hath nothing but a dream for its father, and neither Scripture nor ſhew of reaſon annexed to confirm it.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that the Apoſtle in the afore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> quoted Chapter affirms faith to be imputed for righteouſneſſe, and that it was ſo reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was yet in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion: and thence concluded that therefore we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in time even when wee beleeve, wee grant the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reſpect of foederall juſtification, or Gods tranſient act, concerning declaring a man juſtified to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p>This alone the Apoſtle there aſſerteth, and this is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by our Divines (as hath been ſaid before) not to be untill we actually beleeve. But this is nothing to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no nor to the weakening of our Juſtification, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in God, and in Chriſt before the foundation of the world. This I take to be the ſum of the Doctrine which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> aſperſeth with Antinomianiſm; which I beleeve no other Papiſt, or Arminian had done before him. As well, and properly might hee have termed it Mahometaniſm; for as agreeable is it with the principles of this, as of that. How conſenting it is with the Scripture I leave to the unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Reader to judge. The very flower of all our Proteſtant Writers have aſſerted it in ſuch numbers, as would fill up a page to name them. Neither know I any one Writer which (having not occaſion to manifeſt himſelfe to be of the ſame judgement) hath ever expreſſed himſelfe to diſſent from it: Till Doctor <hi>Downham</hi> excepted againſt Maſter <hi>Pemble</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:167891:152"/> it, and that upon a ſtrange ground, that declared great inadvertency in the reading of the Doct. <hi>viz. That he beleeveth no man had ſo written before Mr. Pemble.</hi> Within theſe ten years indeed, ſome others of great place and name (among our ſelves) have diſrelliſhed it. But (as farre as I can by enquiry find) have not communicated their reaſons to their Brethren, why they did it, therefore ought not to be angry with them, if by an implicite Faith they take not in the ſame diſrelliſh alſo. For my own part I muſt crave the liberty to ſee light for my guidance into the contrary aſſertion, before I lay down this as darkneſs, unto which I at leaſt think my ſelf to have been led by the light of the Word. Yet with theſe Proviſo's (to prevent miſtakes) I adhere to his opinion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That this Immanent Act in God doth not deny his Tranſient Act of Juſtifying man when he beleeveth, any more then this latter doth that former.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Tranſient Act of Juſtification conſiſteth not onely in Gods evidencing and manifeſting to the beleever that he was really juſtified in God from eternity; but alſo in Gods Actual, and Judiciall pronouncing of the ſentence of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to the ſoul drawn to Gods Tribunal, and gaſping for pardon thorough Chriſt. By means whereof the poor ſinner is conſtituted, as well as declared actually, and perſonally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and that before God his Juſtifier.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That as oft as the Goſpel ſpeaketh of Juſtification by Faith, it is in reference to this Tranſient Act of God, not that Immanent.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That as I conceive the Covenant between God and Chriſt to be (if I may ſo term it) a fruit, in order to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent act in God; ſo I think alſo that the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Covenant under the Law, the Covenant under the Goſpel, and the very Covenant of Works to be ſubſervients to this Covenant made with Chriſt as a publick perſon, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting us, to work all coordinately to the advancing of the glory of Gods Grace to his Elect, in juſtifying them in himſelf from Eternity. Yet ſo, that if I find a candid Teacher in any, or all theſe to inform me better, I hope I ſhall not be wanting to ſhew my docility.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould have wholly forborn to touch upon this point (ſo

                        <p>As to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> let him pretend what he will of his zeal againſt this Doctrine, becauſe it is <hi>a Pillar of Antinomianiſm,</hi> yet his conſcience tels him that his rage againſt it is under this conſideration, <hi>as it is a ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> A great queſtion it is, whether Remiſſion and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be Immanent, or Tranſient Acts of God: The miſtake of this one point was that that led thoſe two moſt excellent, famous Divines, Doctor <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> to that errour, and pillar of Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from Eternity. For ſaith Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> often (All acts immanent in God are from Eternity: But Juſtification and Remiſſion of ſins are Immanent acts. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>By [Immanent in God] they muſt needs mean Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, not Poſitively: For Acts have not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of an Adjunct to its Subject, but of an Effect to its Cauſe.</p>
                           <p>Now whether all ſuch Immanent Acts are any more Eternall then Tranſient Acts, is much queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As for God to know that the world doth now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, that ſuch a man is now juſt, or ſanctified, &amp;c. Gods fore knowledge is not a knowing that ſuch a thing is which is not, but that ſuch a thing will be which is not. Yet doth this make no change in God, no more then the Sun is changed by the variety of creatures which it doth enlighten and warm, or the glaſs by the variety of faces which it repreſents, or the eye by the variety of colours which it beholdeth. (For whatſoever ſome ſay, I doe not think that every vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the object maketh a reall cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

But grant that all Gods Immanent Acts are Eternall (which I think is quite
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:167891:153"/> beyond our underſtanding to know) yet moſt Divines will deny the <hi>minor,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tell you that Remiſſion, and Juſtification are Tranſient Acts; which is true, but a truth which I never had the happineſs to ſee well cleared by any. For to prove it a Tranſient Act, they tell us no more, but that it doth <hi>tranſire in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum extraneum,</hi> by making a Morall change on our relatio, though not a reall upon our perſons, as Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication doth. But this is onely to affirme, and not to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ove, and that in generall onely, not telling us what Act it is that maketh this change. Relations are not capable of being the patients, or ſubjects of any Act, ſeeing they be but meer <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> and no reall beings. Neither are they the immediate product, or effect of any Act, but in order of Nature are conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the direct effects. The proper effect of the Act, is to lay the foundation from whence the Relation doth ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the ſame Act which layeth the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth cauſe the Relation, without the intervention of any other.

The direct effect therefore of Gods actuall Juſtification muſt be a reall effect, though not upon the ſinner, yet upon ſomething elſe for him. And thence will his paſſive Juſtification follow. Now what Tranſient Act this is, And what its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate real effect, who hath unfolded, I dare not be too confident in ſo dark a point. But it ſeemeth to me, that this juſtifying tranſient Act is the enacting, or promulgation of the New Covenant, wherein Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is conferred upon every beleever. Here paſſing, and enacting this grant, is a tranſient Act.</p>

But peradventure he thus inſignizeth them in reſpect of the opinion that others have of them, though in his own accompt, or in compariſon with himſelf, he knowes not whither to terme them Cranes or Pigmies. Or it is a peece of that ſubtlety which elſewhere he uſeth frequently, to abuſe the ignorant with a conceit, that all which he delivers is orthodox, becauſe of his pretending himſelf to be an admirer of ſuch, in whom verity and Godlines with profoundneſs in learning are met together. Or laſtly, Ambition of popular glory and praiſe, might invite him ſo to magnify them; The greater the Champions are with whom he Combateth; The more glorious he may conceive his victory to be, if he return out of the field Conqueror; And he might expect that the leſſer and lower rank will be as mute as fiſhes, when they ſee the Claſſicall Doctors of higheſt eſteem once battered by his diſputations.

And yet the grant of it doth not at all weaken the Minor propoſition of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Juſtification</hi> (in the ſenſe oft mentioned) <hi>are Acts immanent in God.</hi> The <hi>Subjectum, Fundamentum, Terminus,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Ratio Fundandi,</hi> are no more wanting in Gods Eternall juſtifying us in Chriſt, than in his Temporaneous juſtifying us declaratively and evidentially to our own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and might be no leſſe confidently upon as good grounds of Reaſon particularized; if we delighted (as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> doth) to bring Gods Acts under the rule and meaſure of the termes of humane Art and learning.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:167891:160"/> declarative juſtifying us in our own conſciences in time, were to confound heaven and earth, eternity and time, together in one. The queſtion is not, whether when God hath by a tranſient act juſtified a ſinner, he knoweth and willeth his juſtification? But whether God did not both knowingly and willingly ſo juſtifie and pardon him through Chriſt, within his own breſt from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? or whether Gods accepting him in Chriſt, and knowing him to be ſo accepted, be begotten in the will and mind of God now in the end of time, and ſo God is not the ſame God in his Knowledge and Will, which he was from eternity?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He verily thinks that the tranſient Acts of God are meant in thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of juſtification by faith,</hi> (for ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he would be underſtood.) And I verily think that he is not enough ſound in his head-peece, whoſoever thinks the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For it were a mad contradictive propoſition to ſay, whoſoever doth, or ſhall beleeve, ſhall be juſtified in himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had a ſelf, or being. But this is no nearer to the matter in queſtion, than the North is to the South pole.</p>
                        <p>As for that barr of God in heaven, that hee concludes with, where his Angelical and Seraphical Doctors that better know the way thence than thither, ſaw at their laſt coming thence, God fitting and tranſacting theſe things before his Angels, we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to wait untill he ſhall have the leiſure after he hath ſpoken once more with <hi>Lucians Icaro-Menippus,</hi> and enquired of him the certainty thereof, and then we ſhall hear the dream inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</p>
                        <p>This is the ſumme of his noble diſpute againſt juſtification, as an act immanent in God from Eternity.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE ſecond thing which I promiſed to take into exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in his explication of this Theſis, is his vellication of the Antinomians, which here and elſewhere throughout this Book he defieth with unquenchable hatred, charging and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging ſo hotly againſt them, as ever <hi>Iupiter</hi> did againſt the Giants that made a battery againſt the Heavens. And what are they, that <hi>Goliah</hi> like, he ſhould come harneſſed from the head to the foot, brandiſhing his weavers beam againſt them? he tells us, <hi>They</hi> are <hi>Ignorant</hi> [animals] <hi>pa. 169.

If ſo, who can abſtain from laughter, to ſee ſo great a Nimrod as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hunting, with no leſſe weapon then <hi>Hercules</hi> his Club, a neſt of wrens to death? and with the great Monarch of the World <hi>Domitian,</hi> to ſet himſelf in battel array againſt the gnats and flies that dared to peep into his chamber.</p>
                        <p>But his aim is to ſhew his Craft more than his power, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in part have manifeſted in the preface to this examination, and there promiſed more fully afterward to evidence: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof, I have reſerved for this place.</p>
                        <p>That we may the better diſcern Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> either ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or doubleneſſe in this Caſe, it ſhall be ſomewhat expedient to enquire after, firſt the originall, ſecondly the growth of the Antinomians properly ſo taken and denominated in the ſeverall reformed Churches, untill our late diviſions within this land have made ſuch a medly and confuſion of all, or at leaſt many errors together, that we know not punctually what error is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in moſt of the willfully erroneous: that having ſeene
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:167891:161"/> them both in their birth, and their full height alſo; wee may compare Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> Antinomians with the Antinomians indeed, and ſo judge how far he goes about to confute the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and how far to defame and deceive the innocent.</p>
                        <p>The firſt riſe of them was in <hi>Germany, Anno. Dom.</hi> 1538. as <hi>Sleidan</hi> in the 12 Book of his Commentaries tells us. Their principall ringleader was <hi>Ioannes Iſlebius, Agricola.</hi> I have not met with any of their Books, neither know I whether there be any of them extant, from which we may certainly gather their opinions. Wee are forced therefore to take them at the ſecond hand from the foreſaid Author, who in the forequoted place thus ſpeaks of them. <hi>Hoc Anno ſecta prodijt eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qui dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Antinomi. Hi poenitentiam ex Decalogo non eſſe docendam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, &amp; illos impugnant qui docent non eſſe praedicandum Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, niſi primum quaſſatis animis, at que fractis per pradicationem legis. Ipſi verò ſtatuunt quaecunque tandem ſit hominis vita, &amp; quamtumvis impura, juſtificari tamen eum, ſi modò promiſſionibus Evangelij credat.</hi> i. e. This year ſprung forth the ſect of them which are called Antinomians. [Their Tenents he reduceth to three generall heads, telling us that firſt] They ſay, <hi>that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not to be taught out of the Decalogue:</hi> [2] They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn them that teach, the Goſpell ought not to be preached to men, untill their hearts be firſt ſhaken and broken by the preaching of the Law. [3] They aſſert that whatſoever the life of a man be, and how impure ſoever, yet is he juſtified if he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeveth the promiſes of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>He addeth further, that <hi>Luther</hi> wrote againſt this <hi>Iſlebius,</hi> who thereupon ſubmitted, and in a ſort recanted; and ſo it ſeemes the Sect ceaſed, and their aſſertions for a while ſlept.</p>
                        <p>Such were they at their firſt riſe. In theſe after times, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves in more plain terms than <hi>Sleidan</hi> here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them. About twenty years ſince, I had acquaintance, and upon that acquaintance, much reaſoning, and many diſputes with ſome of them in <hi>Summer ſet ſhire,</hi> who much honoured and profeſſed themſelves to have received their light from that Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:167891:161"/>1. That the Law is totally abrogated now under the Goſpel, and that not onely as a Covenant of Works, but alſo from being any more the rule of righteouſneſſe. That wee have but one Maſter, Chriſt, that ſince his coming into the world, he is our Teacher ſent from heaven: the Prophet raiſed up like to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that we ſhould hear him alone. That ſince the time he began to ſpeak, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath been ſilent, and we are bound now to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>the voice of God, as in theſe latter times he ſpeaketh to us by his Son only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the whole Old Teſtament is (as it were) uncanonized, though it were the Word of God, the Rule and Canon of Faith, and practice, to them that lived under it; yet to us that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel it remains not in its former power. Becauſe the Laſt Will and Teſtament onely ſtands in force, and when a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teſtament is made, the former is thereby to all uſes and purpoſes made voyd. We may read the Old Teſtament as other Apocryphal, and Eccleſiaſticall Writings, but muſt no more ſubject our judgements or conſciences to it, then to theſe: For <hi>Moſes and the Prophets prophecied</hi> (onely) <hi>untill John the Baptiſt,</hi> were in force untill he began to preach the Goſpel, and ever ſince the <hi>Kingdom of heaven hath ſuffered violence,</hi> the doctrine of the Goſpel hath ſucceeded in its place.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That we have no Sabbath under the Goſpel, but all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in dayes, and difference between dayes and dayes is taken away; ſo that to ſanctifie any one day to the Lord above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is meer Wil-worſhip, and Superſtition. Upon this ground they actually made uſe of ſhooting, bowling, and other lawful recreations upon the Lords day, pronouncing it to be a uſe of the Liberty which Chriſt had purchaſed for them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They diſreliſhed altogether that phraſe of Juſtification by Faith, as attributing ſomewhat to man; and would that all ſhould rather ſay that we are Juſtified by Grace, or by Chriſt or by being found in Chriſt, or by our union unto Chriſt, that the praiſe of our Juſtification might be reſerved whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Grace of God in Chriſt alone.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That we are juſtified by the Paſſive, not the Active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That God ſeeth no ſinne in the juſtified, he knows indeed when they ſinne, and that they have ſinned, but the doth not ſee it becauſe themſelves and it are covered under the righteouſnes,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:167891:162"/> and croſs of Chriſt, ſo that the Father doth not, will not ſee it. As if the eternal God had any other eyes beſides the eyes of his knowledge to ſee; or that Gods ſeeing, and his knowing were at leaſt diſparats, and not the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That God puniſheth not ſinne in his people, for he ſeeth not ſin in his people, and what he ſeeth not, that he cannot pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. He hath puniſhed it upon Chriſt, therefore are they free from puniſhment.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That whatſoever is not in preciſe words forbidden in the New Teſtament, that is lawfull for a Chriſtian to doe, how ſtrictly ſoever it be prohibited in the Law, and Old Teſtament. So that I have taken notice that when in diſputes, ſuch and ſuch things have been denyed to be expreſly forbidden in the New Teſtament, and that they could not finde any clear teſtimonies of the New Teſtament literally forbidding them; though before they made it a caſe of conſcience to abſtain, yet thenceforth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that is ſaid in the Old Teſtament againſt it, they have taken full liberty to commit it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things were formerly (as farre as I have taken notice) either all, or the chief things, branded with the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm. And they that held them were called by the moſt Antinomiſts, or Antinomians, becauſe either in all, or moſt of theſe aſſertions, they either did, or ſeemed to oppoſe, and ſet themſelves againſt the Law, or Old Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>In theſe laſt ſeven or eight years indeed, wherein all the Ghoſts of all the Hereticks of former Ages have been let looſe from hell in full ſwarms, to infeſt this Nation more then ever the Locuſts did the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and men in wantonizing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his Truth, have thought it too little to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans budget-bearers in ſome, except they had their packs filled with all varieties of his hell-bred errors, ſo that the Legion of Devils now might be found ſometimes in one man, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore was diſtributed into a legion of men: By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many Hereſies moulded together have gone under one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; partly through ignorance, and partly out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, both all the dreames of mad E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:167891:162"/> many Devils, that he might be taken for one of them, and the truth of his Goſpel bee abandoned under the name of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</p>
                        <p>But as to the forementioned tenents in former times charged with Antinomianiſm, I ſhall ſay ſomething.</p>
                        <p>Firſt thoſe three mentioned by <hi>Sleidan,</hi> as he expreſſeth them, it is very ambiguous whether they were truths or errors. Becauſe the words by which he deſcribes them, are ambiguous: and may be taken either in a good, or evill ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That they taught that Repentance is not to be taught out of the Decalogue: It is doubtfull what his meaning is; 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they denyed it to be taught ſimply, or <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> either that it ought not to be thence taught at all, or not to be taught thence, as ordained and effectual to juſtification, and ſalvation? 2. It is doubtfull alſo what hee meanes by the Decalogue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he means the Ten Commandements conſidered ſtrictly in their own words, as meer Law (for ſo I ſee not how repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can be taught properly out of the Decalogue, becauſe it commandeth perfect obedience, that there may be no need of repentance) or as the Doctrine of the ſaid Decalogue is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, and expounded in other Scriptures: where we ſhall find indeed Repentance required in caſe of tranſgreſſion, with a promiſe of temporall deliverances and bleſſings annexed; and ſo the teaching of Repentance out of the Law be here oppoſed to the teaching of it out of the Goſpel, and conſequentially the Legall be here oppoſed to the Evangelical Repentance? 3. Or whether his meaning be, that they would not have repentance at all taught, becauſe they took it to be a meerly Legall, not an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical duty, therefore pertaining to the adminiſtration of the Law, not of the Goſpel? I conceive the Hiſtorian being a man ſingular for his moderation in all that he writes, though he ſpeaks of their opinion in the eaſieſt words he may, yet meanes that they held it in the worſt ſenſe, (And ſuch have been the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians in theſe latter times) otherwiſe in a good ſenſe, that his words will bear, this firſt tenet deſerves not the name of Antinomianiſm, or error.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond, if his meaning be, that they impugned thoſe that preached the Law to ſhake the hearts of men into ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and to break down the proud confidence of ſafety, and righteouſneſſe in themſelves, thereby to make way for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:167891:163"/> of Chriſt into them: There is ſomething indeed worthy of blame layd to their charge. But if we take his words ſtrictly as they lye, <hi>viz.</hi> that they oppoſed them <hi>which teach that the Goſpel is not to be preached untill the Law hath ſo convinced, and ſhaken the conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. I profeſſe my ſelf to be an Antinomian alſo, if this be Antinomianiſm. For what warrant hath any Miniſter ſo to teach? The commiſſion which we receive from Chriſt is, <hi>to preach the Goſpel to every creature in all the world.</hi> Mar. 16. 15. without any reſtriction whether they be ſhaken, or unſhaken: And if we continue Law-ſhakers ſtill among ſome people, untill wee ſee them thereby ſhaken into a Palſie of ſelfe-deſpairing, I know no ground we have to promiſe to our ſelves a time of preaching Goſpel ſo long as we live. And what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer can be given in ſuch a caſe to Chriſt for following our own carnall wiſdome, and not his commiſſion? Neither was it one of <hi>Luthers</hi> praiſes (<hi>pace tanti viri dixerim</hi>) from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods working upon himſelf, which was firſt the laying of him proſtrate by the Law under great horrors, and then revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him with the precious comforts of the Goſpel; to preſcribe unto God the ſame method, or to conclude the ſame to bee the method of God in his operations upon all in converting them. The rending whirlwind doth not alway goe before the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beams of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the third, if he mean that they taught that Juſtification by Faith in the Goſpel promiſes might be ſound and effectuall, though no ſanctification, but all allowed impurity of life ſhould follow; the aſſertion and doctrine implies a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for there can be no living Faith in the promiſes, that is not fruitfull in good works: And herein they declared themſelves no leſſe Anti-Goſpellers, then Antinomians. But if hee meane that without all ſuch extream horrors of the Law, a man may be truly juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, notwithſtanding all his former looſe and impure life, and ſo the Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdome of God before the ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phariſees; this is not Antinomiſtick, except <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine alſo be ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for thoſe opinions charged in theſe latter times with Antinomianiſm by many, the 1, 2, and laſt cannot be excuſed. Onely (to give the Aſſertors their due) whatſoever of doctrinal truths to be beleeved, or of Moral duties to be practiſed, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:167891:163"/> both in the Old and New Teſtament, they were conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious to ſubmit themſelves thereunto, yet not for the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law, or Old Teſtament, but of the New only.</p>
                        <p>The third can bee juſtly charged with Antinomianiſm no farther, then as either the Maintainers of it were in other points Antinomiſts, or in reſpect of the foundation, which they laid to maintain it, which was the abrogation of the Law and old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Law of the Sabbath being one part therof, which muſt ſtand or ſink with the reſt. But as they denyed the lawfulneſs of all diſcrimination or difference of daies, by way of Morall, or Eccleſiaſtical, or Apoſtolical order, for the more orderly, and profitable celebration of publick Aſſemblies, and the ordinances of Chriſt in publick Communion, calling it Will-worſhip, and Superſtition: This error they drew from the <hi>Petrobuſians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> not from the <hi>Antinomians</hi> that had been before them. As to other queſtions about the authority of the Sabbath firſt, &amp; now of the Lords day, what relation they have either to other, whether the obſervation of them be of Natural, or Poſitive right: If of Moral and Natural right, by what expreſs authority it is altered from the laſt, to the firſt day of the week? If of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive right, whether it began from the Creation, or from the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> Whether the fourth Commandement hath any thing in it Typical, now vaniſhed in Chriſt? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly Moral, and binding for ever? how far it did, or did not bind preciſely to <hi>a</hi> day, &amp; not <hi>this</hi> day of 7? Whether it were of Moral Righteouſnes, or elſe only of Moral order? Whether the holyneſs of the 7th be now wholly tranſlated upon the firſt day of the week? By what authority the obſervation of the ſeventh day ceaſed, and of the firſt day of the week was inſtituted to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? Whether by virtue of Chriſts Reſurrection, or by ſome expreſs command of Chriſt? and where that command is to bee found? Or elſe by Apoſtolical appointment? And then whether in reſpect of order, or of the aforegoing authority of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement about the Sabbath? or elſe by the appointment and conſent of the Churches in, or after the Apoſtles times? Theſe, and many other the like queſtions Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knoweth to have been in agitation between both the greater and the leſſer Divines and Members of the Reformed Churches, <hi>&amp; adhuc ſub judice Lis eſt.</hi> Onely ſome within the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince a Tractate came forth upon this ſubject from one Dr. <hi>Bownd, Anno
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:167891:164"/> Chriſti</hi> 1595. ſeem to fix the obſervation of the Lords day upon more ſtrict grounds, and to bind it to more preciſe termes then the other Reformed Churches beyond the ſeas admit, or many of the ſolid Divines have approved. But of this there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſion here given to diſpute. This aſſertion therefore, any further then hath been ſpecified, I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will diſcharge of Antinomianiſm.</p>
                        <p>The 5. &amp; 7. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf will not have to be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Antinomian errors, confeſſing the former to be the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many learned, and godly Divines, of ſingular eſteem in the Church of God, pag. 53. &amp; Ap. pag. 12. The latter hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to be the Common Judgement, <hi>viz.</hi> of Churches, and Divines; therefore of ignorance accuſed of Antinomianiſm, pag. 68 of his Aphoriſms.</p>
                        <p>The fourth gives us cauſe to accuſe them of ſome audaciouſnes, in teaching the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeake, and pertinaciouſneſs in binding themſelves to phraſes and words, even to the declining of the language of the Holy Ghoſt in Scriptures. To be juſtified by Faith, and to bee juſtified by Chriſt, or our being found in Chriſt, being ever both in Canonical, and Eccleſiaſtical Writings taken as Equipollent terms, until in theſe few laſt years Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> and ſome of his fellows irradiated from <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> have broached another, a new, and unheard of interpretation of the phraſes. For whether we ſay we are juſtified by Faith, wee were formerly underſtood to affirm our Juſtification by Chriſt, to whom our Faith hath united us; or by Chriſt, it was underſtood by Chriſt apprehended by faith. Neither manner of Locution therefore was to be rejected, as oppoſing the other.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth I take to be a fancy (if they underſtand Gods ſeeing and knowing in generall, without reſtriction) troubling the brains of men with a ſtrife about words without ſubſtance. God ſeeth no ſin unpardoned upon his people, we acknowledge. In reference to Judgement and Vengeance, hee hath ſeen them all upon Chriſt, and puniſhed them upon Chriſt, ſo that he no more ſees ſinne in beleevers, to take vengeance of them for it. But it were our loſs and miſery, if God ſhould not at all, and ſimply ſee ſinne in us; How then ſhould he purge it from us, and us from it? He is the Husbandman of his Vineyard, ſees, and cuts out every canker from his Vines, ſeeth, and pareth off every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:167891:164"/> ſprigg from the branches, by meanes whereof fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe followeth, where elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there muſt enſue barrenneſſe and rottenneſſe. Some Divines therefore thus diſtinguiſh, that Gods ſeeing of ſin may be conſidered as either in <hi>Articulo providentiae,</hi> (ſo he ſeeth all ſinns of all men alike to diſpoſe of them to his glory,) or in <hi>Articulo Iuſtificationis,</hi> (ſo he ſeeth the ſinnes onely of the unjuſtified; <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 23. Forget not their iniquity, neither blot out their ſin from thy ſight: but the ſinnes of the juſtified are forgotten, and blotted out of his remembrance and ſight (as the conſtant phraſe of Scripture affirmeth) no more to be imputed. If they mean onely in this latter ſenſe, they erre not.</p>
                        <p>By that which hath been ſaid, we may eaſily perceive (without any further and new ſumming up the particulars) what the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are which may be truly and properly charged with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſm, and gave firſt the Term of Antinomiſm to the Aſſertors.</p>
                        <p>Now let us ſee alſo what the Tenents of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſts are, and what opinions he curſeth to Hell, unde the name of Antinomianiſm. Their Hereſies according to Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> are theſe which follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Juſtification is, or there is a Juſtification from Eternity. <hi>pag.</hi> 93.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is an immanent act in God. <hi>pa.</hi> 173.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That our Evangelicall righteouſneſſe by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is without us in Chriſt. <hi>pa.</hi> 109. or performed by Chriſt, and not by our ſelves. <hi>pa.</hi> 111.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That Juſtification is a free act of God, without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our part. <hi>pa.</hi> 169, 170.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That God ſeeth not ſin in his juſtified ones, <hi>pa.</hi> 207.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That we muſt not work or perform duties for life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from life and ſalvation: or that we muſt not make the attaining of juſtification, or ſalvation, an end of our endeavours, but obey in thankfullneſſe onely, becauſe we are ſaved and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>pa.</hi> 324, 325. 330.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That they acknowledge no condition of life, but bare beliefe in the narroweſt ſenſe, that is, either belief of pardon, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Reconciliation, or affiance in Chriſt, for it: ſo alſo they acknowledg no proper damning ſin, but unbelief, in that ſtrict ſenſe, as is oppoſite to this faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> the not believing in Chriſt as our Saviour. <hi>Append<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pa.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To theſe he addeth many more, (or rather moſtly the ſame
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:167891:165"/> in other Termes) out of the Marrow of Modern Divinity, (I mean the book ſo entitled) which in due place we may as far as ſhall be thought needfull, examine. <hi>Appen. pa.</hi> 100. to <hi>pa.</hi> 106.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, he ſeems to accuſe them of all the prodigious Doctrines which <hi>Colyer, Spriggs, Hobſon,</hi> and the reſt of that Anabaptiſtical, Enthuſiaſticall, and phanatick ſtrain of men, have (if indeed they be of them that have at any time) ſaid and unſaid; whether ſuch as they have derived from <hi>Nicolas Stock, David George, Thomas Muncer, John</hi> of <hi>Leyden, Cniperdolins,</hi> &amp;c. and others of the ſame ſtamp in theſe latter times: or ſuch as either of them hath by a kind of Necromancy raiſed up from the aſhes of <hi>Manes, Samoſatenus, Arrius,</hi> and other curſed Hereticks of antient times. All theſe he would willingly inure upon the Antinomians, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon them that will not ſay the ſame things with him, who ſpeaks the ſame things with the Jeſuits in the point of Juſtification. This he doth ſubtlely, and underhand, to beguile his unwary reader. <hi>Append. pa.</hi> 99.</p>
                        <p>Of all theſe onely the fift hath been (as far as ever I could finde) by any conſiderate and judicious perſon, nicknamed with Antinoniſm, untill Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> and ſome other of his fellowes in theſe late years have taken upon them a Soveraignty, as Lords and judges from <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, which they have Canonized again, to baptiſe with new names, all the Doctrines of the Goſpell that croſſe the pride of their ſelfe-ighteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>And even the ſift it ſelf in Scripture ſenſe (as I have before ſhewed) is a Soul-comforting truth, which we muſt no more ſuffer to be wreſted from us, than our Chriſt and all our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by him, <hi>vizt.</hi> that God ſeeth not ſin in his juſtified ones, to impute i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, to hate and condemn them for it. Hee ſeeth not the guilt of any ſin upon them, having laid it and the condemnation to which it obliged, upon Chriſt Jeſus. But that God doth not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſee ſin in them, either Originall or Actuall, to act about it in a way of grace and truth, according to his promiſes in Chriſt; This I take to be a foppery, the fruit of mens willfullneſſe, and pertinacity, to have their own words and phraſes ſtand as impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as Chriſts truth lapt up in them. Let it be called Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſm, or Antigoſpelliſm, or what elſe Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> will ſtile it, I ſhall not herein withſtand him; To me the truth and ſpirit of the Doctrines conteined in the word, ſufficeth, the letter I ſhall no further propugn or oppugn, than as through it the ſpirit and truth is levelled at.</p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:167891:165"/>
                        <p>To the firſt and ſecond I have before ſpoken, and let any man upon earth be produced, that ever charged them with Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm, ſaving Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelfe, or one of his Diſciples: And if they be Antinomian Tenents, then is Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> one of thoſe Antinomians, being forced after his long and impotent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill againſt, as laſt to grant both; as wee have before ſeen.</p>
                        <p>To the third, I have alſo before anſwered. Neither hath Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> named, nor can he (I am confident) name one man, but either a Papiſt, or at beſt an Arminian, that before him hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called Faith and Goſpel obedience the Evangelicall Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by which we are juſtified: Or that hath denyed our goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtified to be without us, in Chriſt. So that he pronounceth here all the orthodox of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea, all profeſſed Chriſtians, ſaving Papiſts, Arminians, and (perhaps) Socinians to be Antinomians: So much of Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pride and impudence poſſeſſeth him.</p>
                        <p>To the fourth and ſeventh I anſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That they are contradictory either to other. For how can both be true, that they affirm Juſtification to be a free Act of God without any condition on our part, and yet teach alſo Faith or affiance in Chriſt to be a [neceſſary] condition of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who ſhall take upon him to defend him that arraigneth and proveth himſelf to be a ſlanderer?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Yet may it without contradiction be both affirmed, that Juſtification as an act immanent and Eternall in God, is abſolute and without condition, but as it is tranſient and Terminate upon the conſcience of a believer, not to be without condition.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Scripture never nameth Faith, much leſſe works, the condition of Juſtification in time; to queſtion whether Faith itſelf may not more properly be termed by ſome other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tion in reference to juſtification, than a Condition, is no peece of Antinomiſm, but a point of Chriſtian prudence to conſider and examine: ſpecially at ſuch a time when Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Popes Factors, under the word <hi>condition</hi> beſtirre themſelves to re-erect Juſtification by works.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That Juſtification by that which Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> abaſingly calleth bare belief, or affiance in Chriſt the Saviour, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Faith without works, is no Antinomian Doctrine, but the Doctrine which Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, have preached
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:167891:166"/> and ſealed with their blood; that which all the reformed Churches have unanim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uſly maintained, and do maintain unto this day: and that which Antichriſt with his vaſſalls, and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatized from the reformed Churches to them do purſue with fire and fury unto ruine. With whom though Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> come up in the rear, driving Jehu like furiouſly in his Charriot, to deſtroy it, yet ſhall it ſtand impregnable, as the prime Article of their Creed, who either are, or ſhall be juſtified and ſaved.</p>
                        <p>To the ſixth, I ſhall reſerve my anſwer untill I come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the forequoted places of Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> together with his impetuous and fiery diſpute againſt it, <hi>Append. pa.</hi> 76. and <hi>thence forward unto</hi> pa. 98. where wee ſhall find him combating againſt this opinion, with as much gallantry, and poſſibly with no leſſe ſucceſſe than the Dragon fought againſt <hi>Michael.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the interim, I doubt not thence (after the queſtion rightly ſtated) to maintain the poſition, as our Divines moſt eminent in the reformed Churches have taught it, to be the ſacred and ſound Doctrine of the Goſpell, as free from Antinomiſm, as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſſertion of Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is full of Popery.</p>
                        <p>The examination of the things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conteined in the eighth and ninth, I ſhall leave to their proper place, particularly to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they have a multitude of particulars congeſted in them, requiring particular anſwers.</p>
                        <p>From all that hath been ſaid upon this point, wee may take up two obſervations, in reference to Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> dealing therein.</p>
                        <p>1. That there is no truth and ſincerity in his pretence of fighting againſt the Antinomians (truly ſo called) throughout this his Tractate, (For he medleth not at all with their erroneous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents:) But contrariwiſe, that he uſeth meer fraud, to inure the odious Term of Antinomiſm upon the choice and moſt pretious Doctrines of the Goſpel, delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and taught and defended by the moſt able and moſt faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt in all ages, to make both the pure Goſpel, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders thereof, to ſtink in the noſtrills of unread and unwary men: ſubtlely concealing the names of thoſe worthies which have taught and maintained theſe truths, leſt their light and glory ſhould bring his Doctrines, contrary to theirs, into ſuſpition firſt, then to examination, and laſtly to an abhomination among men. How much more candour do we find in his fellowes the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:167891:166"/> Arminians, or Remonſtrants? Theſe in all their Tenents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they diſſent from the Proteſtant Churches, do not load the contrary opinion with the imputation of Antinomiſm; but throughout their Apology, ever and anon ingeniouſly confeſſe of that which they hold, <hi>Contra quod fere hactenus creditum eſt,</hi> in theſe, and in words equipollent, acknowledging ſtill their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be wholly againſt the judgement of the beſt Churches and Divines before them. Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> it ſeems hath more of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in him than they had, therefore followes the ſteps of our Engliſh Arminians, rather than thoſe in <hi>Holland</hi> before them. For as theſe blaſted the ſacred truths which they oppoſed with the name of Puritaniſm, ſo doth this man with the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm, to make them odious. A trick which the old Phariſees had learned of their Father, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 44. and propagated to their ſonns the Papiſts, to beſmear the Doctrines of Chriſt with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous titles of Schiſm, Nazariſm, Hereſie. Who then will lay it as a fault to their Children in our times, if they doe alſo <hi>Patrizare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, that he hath the like fraudulent deſign in mingling with the truths of the Goſpel, which he brandeth with Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſm, the dreams of <hi>Colyer, Spriggs, Hobſon,</hi> and other Ranters, (if indeed theſe be ſuch, for I have not read them) giving the ſame brand to theſe as to the former; by this feat endeavouring to inſtill into the mindes of them that will be deceived,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That all the hereticall and blaſphemous Doctrines which theſe men teach, are Antinomian.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the truthes which the one ſide teach againſt Antichriſt, and the Blaſphemies which the other ſide vent againſt Chriſt, are of one Nature, and the former to be no leſſe abhorred than the latter. Now if the Pamphlets of theſe men be ſo abhominable as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmeth, and others alſo that are both able to judge, and faithfull to give their judgement, have told me; (for I acknowledge my ſelf never to have been ſo ill at leiſure to ſpend two hours in reading what any, or all of them have written) he dealeth unjuſtly to yoake them together with thoſe tenents which he falſely accuſeth of Antinomiſm, yea, with thoſe that are rightly fathered upon Antinomians indeed. For granting that they hold ſome Tenents of the Antinomians, yet this neither ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that all their hereſies and blaſphemies are ſo many peeces of Antinomiſm; Nor yet that the Antinomians ſpeaking the ſame
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:167891:167"/> things with theſe in the points proper to their ſect, do alſo cloſe with them in their abhominable Doctrines that are totally alien from the Antinomiſts Tenents. Elſe becauſe Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Jeſuits in the Doctrine of Juſtification by works, we might conclude that in all points he is a Jeſuit, holdeth not onely lies, equivocations, and mentall reſervations; but alſo mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Maſſacres, Seditions, Powder treaſons, and all other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deviſed in hell it ſelf, to be Meritorious works, if done to the advancing of <hi>Romes</hi> intereſt. And becauſe he holdeth the very Act of believing to juſtifie, with the Socinians, therefore he is in all other the moſt blaſphemous of their aſſertions againſt Chriſt and his blood, a Socinian alſo: or on the other ſide, that the Jeſuits and Socinians are in all things, becauſe in ſome things of the ſame judgement with Maſter <hi>Baxter.</hi> Were it the truth of Chriſt which Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> goeth about to propagate, he would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſeek the propagation of it in Chriſts Spirit, and Chriſts way. When we ſee ſuch ſerpentine windings and crookedneſſe in his diſputes, who can but judge that it is the work of the Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent about which he is imployed? Neither the truth of Chriſt, nor Chriſt which is the truth, have any ſuch impotency in them, as to need any deceits and ſhifts for their ſupport. When Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> yea when all the Jeſuits have raiſed all their miſts of Sophiſtry, Sycophancy contumely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thick as the ſmoke from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, to dim the beams of Gods grace ſhining forth in the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe; not one Raie thereof ſhall be thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, <hi>it ſhall hide the</hi> [pure light of the] <hi>Goſpell onely from them that periſh, whoſe eies the God of this World hath blinded.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 3, 4. No one Soul ſhall be thereby beguiled, ſave thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that were made to be taken and deſtroyed,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 12.</p>
                        <p>A large Catalogue more of the Antinomian Tenents are ſet forth by Maſter <hi>Anthony Burgeſs,</hi> affixed to his Lectures againſt them: Which he ſaith he hath gathered from <hi>Luthers</hi> works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. I will not queſtion his faithfullneſſe in collecting them, whether <hi>Iſlebius</hi> and his Diſciples directly maintained ſuch Doctrines; or whether <hi>Luther</hi> in proſecuting them, enumerates theſe as abſurdities that would follow upon their Doctrine? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are imaginary, or reall opinions of any ſect of men, the moſt of them are deteſtable. But I find not that either Maſter <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bax,</hi> can name any one creature under the Sun, that hath declared by words or writing, that he held them. If they can,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:167891:167"/> we ſhall joyn with them, as diſſenters from, and excepters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every ſuch perſon. That theſe Antinomians of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age were filthy dreamers, looſe livers, ſuch as turned the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt into laſciviouſneſs, is very probable, if not certain, from that which <hi>Calvin</hi> and others have written againſt Antinomians and Libertines. And from ſuch we have no leſs abhorrence then Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>Lawyers have layd it down for a Maxim, <hi>Non eſt diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ubi Lex non diſtinguit.</hi> i. e. We are not to diſtinguiſh of any point in the Law, where the Law it ſelf hath not made a diſtinction. If the Laws of men are not, much leſſe are the Laws, and Word of God to be violated with mens bold diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: For this is no leſſe then to bring Gods ſacred Oracles into a ſubjection to mans vain fancies. Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhew any Scripture that gives footing for the diſtinguiſhing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification into that which is in title of Law, and that which is in ſentence of judgement, into conſtitutive and declarative, or virtuall, and actuall Juſtification. Theſe are the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wanton wits in theſe latter times, whoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it hath been to tear in peeces, and thereby wholly nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie Gods Juſtification, and to put many Juſtifications of their own in ſtead thereof. We deny not a conſtitutive and declarative Juſtification in ſome ſenſe, but in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe we deny it. It is granted that the Satisfaction which the Son by promiſe gave, and the Father accepted for the ſins of the Elect, according to the Covenant between the Father and the Son, before more then once mentioned, did conſtitute the Elect juſtified in Chriſt before they were born; who notwithſtanding were not declared juſt to their own conſciences before they actually beleeved; nor to others until they manifeſted their Faith by their Works. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> explodes this conſtitutive, and declarative Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an unſufferable abhomination, and will not have his virtuality, and actuality to theſe applyed. And let him alleage any one Scripture that calls the ſentence of life (unto thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved by grace) that is to be pronounced in the laſt day, Juſtification: Or if he cannot, but that the juſtification of the New Covenant, wherever it be mentioned in the Word, be that which is in this preſent life, who ſees not that his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing here tends to the ſubverting of Scriptures, and of the both virtual, and actual Juſtification which the Scriptures ſpeak of?</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of it many times as a future thing, and not yet done. <hi>Rom. 3. 30. Mat. 12. 37. Rom. 2. 13. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic.</hi> pag. 185.</q>
                        <p>This is all that he bringeth, or can bring for Juſtification in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:167891:168"/> the day of Judgement; and this all is nothing. It followeth not becauſe theſe Scriptures ſpeak of Juſtification as of a thing to come, ſaying, they <hi>ſhall be,</hi> not they <hi>are</hi> juſtified; that this Future tenſe doth point out the day of Judgement. If I ſhould ſay, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall dye, I ſhould not be accuſed for ſpeaking an untruth; but if any will needs confine that [<hi>ſhall</hi>] to the day of Judgement, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall then dye, who would not laugh at the abſurdity of the conſequence? That of <hi>Mat. 12. 37. By thy words thou ſhalt be justified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned;</hi> and that of <hi>Rom. 2. 13. Not the hearers, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified;</hi> ſpeak of Juſtification after the tenor and covenant of the Law, not of Grace; therefore pertain nothing to the preſent purpoſe. Hee ſhall but <hi>Dare verba,</hi> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably deceive with words, that teacheth men to ſeek for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the righteouſneſs of the Law conſiſting in deeds and words. Whoſoever indeed ſhall neither in word or deed be found a tranſgreſſor of the Law actually or originally, ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his words and deeds. But this man muſt be ſought for out of a happier generation then thoſe of the race of <hi>Adam;</hi> elſe (if we except Chriſt alone) we muſt return our <hi>Non eſt inventus.</hi> That of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 30. ſpeaks indeed in the Future tenſe, but may be as properly rendred, by the word [<hi>will</hi>] as [<hi>ſhall</hi>] (though the difference be not very conſiderable) thus, <hi>It is one God which will</hi> [or <hi>ſhall] juſtifie the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion through Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle here meaneth no otherwiſe, ſpeaking here in the Future, then what he had ſaid before in the Preſent Tenſe of Juſtification. And it is as if he had ſaid, God hath decreed and declared his method of juſtifying both Jews &amp; Gentiles to be one and the ſame. As long as there remain, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any upon earth of either part to be juſtified, the purpoſe of God abides firm to juſtifie as wel the one as the other by faith, and no one of either ſort by Works; neither circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion ſhall avail, or hinder any thing, but Chriſt, faith in Chriſt ſhall bee all unto all in this buſineſſe, as long as the world endureth. And what is there then in this Text to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ove Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> declarative Juſtification in the day of Judgement? Not that wee deny the adjudging of life in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all that in this life were juſtified; but the Scriptures terming this laſt ſentence by the name of Juſtification, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſaid of Juſtification by Faith or Grace, is ſtill to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:167891:169"/> in this life. And the whole reaſon that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath here to coyn a Juſtification in the day of judgement, is to lay a foundation of Popiſh Juſtification by Works; as by the ſequele of this his Treatiſe will more fully appear. Elſe would we not contend with him about meer words, did they not tend to a deſtructive end; and that we are taught by him elſwhere, <hi>That no advantage is to be given to the Papiſts in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> To ſay that the laſt ſentence of judgement ſhall declare to Men and Angels that the Elect were juſtified in this life by faith in him, is according to the voice of the Word. But to ſay that they ſhall be then fully Juſtified, as if their Juſtification had not been before compleated, is to out-throw the Bar two foot beyond the Papiſts for the maintenance of their ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and to ſpeak more for them then they had wit, or grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe to ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is that in the beginning of his Explication, pag. 183. he forbears to mention other diſtinctions which are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in others, and may be found in Mr.</hi> Bradſhaw, <hi>Mr.</hi> John Goodwin, <hi>and</hi> Alſtedius, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>they are not ſo neceſſary and pertinent to my purpoſed ſcope,</hi> which is to deſtroy Juſtification by Grace, and erect in place thereof Juſtification by Works. It is a ſuperlative praiſe that he giveth theſe men (how wel deſerved by ſome of them I know not) that they are travelling another way from him, their faces are toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he cannot obtain a word of direction from them, but muſt truſt to his own Compaſs to guide him to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What he hath more in the Explication, is but the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own dream: And I have not ſuperſtition enough to keep me awaked, and attentive to dreams, and their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p>Neither is there any thing elſe in his 38 Theſis, and its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but a further forming of the ſame Chimaera<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Nothing, created out of his brain in the former Poſition, and its Explication. Or if there be any thing beſides, it hath been examined in the precedent Chapter.</p>
                        <p>With no leſſe ſilence might I alſo paſſe by the 39 Theſis, and its Explication, as being of the ſame nature with the former; ſaving that there are two things that wee may glance our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration upon, before we paſſe further, leſt that we ſhould ſeem to look aſide from any thing that hath an appearance of weight
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:167891:169"/> and ſtrength in it to confirme his doctrine, of a Juſtification, or pardon of ſin in ſentence of Judgement, contradiſtinct from that which he maketh to conſiſt in Title of Law. To make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that beſides the Juſtification here, there ſhall bee another Juſtification in the day of Judgement, hee addeth theſe two things unto what he had before ſaid.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. An explication of the form of future Juſtification, and Pardon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another Text of Scripture, beſides the former, to evince it. The former he hath in theſe words of that his Theſis, That it ſhall be an acquitting of the ſinner at Gods publique Bar.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> From the accuſation and condemnation of the Law pleaded againſt him by Satan. For pag. 189. in the Explic. the accuſation of his guilt will be managed againſt him by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hereafter, from which accuſation he ſhall be then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</q>
                        <p>Who is there now that can doubt of a Juſtification after this life, when he hath heard ſo graphicall a deſcription of it? But how came Satan and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be of ſo great acquaintance, that either ſhall know the others purpoſe about the Judgement to come? I had thought the Devill had made known onely to his friends, not to his adverſaries, what he means to do to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, much leſſe what hee meanes to doe in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſhould have conjectured that he is more taken up with the horror of torments that he ſhall ſuffer, then with the thought of further actings in that terrible day. Neither did I until now finde that Satan ſhould be an accuſer of others, having not what to ſay for the defence of himſelf, being accuſed by others, as the author of their ſinne and miſery in the day of Judgement. Neither can I find yet that the Scripture teacheth any ſuch thing, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould be able to ſay, <hi>he hath received from the Lord what he doth here diſcover to us.</hi> It muſt be from ſome Apocrypha's, or out of the left ſide of the Romiſh Legend that hee hath borrowed this doctrine, where I ſhall leave him to dig out more traditions to maintain his bold aſſertions, that have no pillarage from Scripture to ſuſtain them.</p>
                        <p>The latter, <hi>vizt.</hi> the Text of Scripture which he alleageth to the ſame end wee have in the beginning of the Explication thus.</p>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:167891:171"/> And no more doth this Scripture uphold this Juſtification, as in other termes he propoſed it, calling it Actuall, as diſtinct from that which he terms virtuall.

                        <p>When contrary to all this Sophiſticall winding, circling and labyrinthicall Mazes, the Scripture ſpeaking of Juſtification and condemnation after the tenor of the Covenants, makes onely two Barrs of judgment, the Bar of juſtice according to the Law, and the Bar of grace or Mercy-ſeat, according to the Tenor of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or New Covenant: affirming all that are judged at the one condemned, and all at the other juſtified. That as ſoon as we are convicted of death, and vengeance onely due to us at the former, we are carried out in the Spirit of Chriſt thorow the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted way of his purifying blood, to ſeek remiſſion of ſinnes at the latter, the Throne of grace; the all gracious Father, from the bar of grace pronounceth to our conſciences peace, and pardon, and joy which ſhall never be taken from us. This is the ſole and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Juſtification which the Scripture ſpeakes of, ſpeaking properly of juſtification. The ſubject hath heaped up Treaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Prince; For this cauſe the Law apprehends and arraigns him. The Princes Son pittieth and mediateth, and by Mediation obtaines a pardon from the Prince, and brings it under hand and ſeal, puts it into his hand for life, while ſtanding at the Princes Law bar, he was by Law condemned, yea condemned himſelfe. The pardon thus freely given, he cannot but gratefully embrace.

To the firſt, I demand whether the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life be not an acquitting by ſentence of judgement at the bar? Whether it be not a ſentence of abſolution pronounced to the ſoul and conſcience of a ſinner drawn to Gods bar, and there impleaded, and confeſſing it ſelf guilty of ſin, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? Who was there ever of them whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> vouchſafeth to call our Divines, that held otherwiſe? Where
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:167891:173"/> then is the difference? Yes, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> this latter is at the publique bar. I anſwer, ſo is the former even that bar of God, at which all that ever have been, are, or ſhall be juſtified, have, and ſhall have the ſentence of Juſtification pronounced to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But this latter ſhall be at the great and grand generall Aſſizes, before all the hoſt of heaven, earth, and hell; whereas the former was but between God and the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> This is nothing elſe but a publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declaration to the world, what God had before granted to the ſoul; which indeed in judicatures of men, which are mutable, and deny oft in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick what they had before acted in ſecret, may be of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to him that is ſo publickly acquitted; but in reſpect of Gods judgement, who cannot be inconſiſtent with himſelf, and whoſe acts in ſecret are as unreverſible as thoſe in publick, here is nothing added to the bulk of juſtification, nor any thing (but the ſolemnity of the manifeſtation of it after the man is before compleatly juſtified) to the circumſtances thereof.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond I have ſpoken before, that Satans managing of the accuſation and condemnation of the Law is more properly, if not onely in this life, and let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> prove (if he can) any ſuch accuſation that hee ſhall manage againſt us in the day of judgement: If he can prove it, the thing proved proves no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or encreaſe which ſhall be then made to our preſent juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe here alſo we are acquitted againſt all accuſations pleaded by Satan. If he prove it not, then there is in this reſpect a <hi>magis</hi> in the circumſtance of juſtification here, beyond that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary juſtification in the day of judgement.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When he addeth, that we muſt underſtand our Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming our Juſtification to be perfect at firſt, and to admit of no degrees, that they mean <hi>our Righteouſneſſe is perfect, and admits not of degrees,</hi> I demand which righteouſneſs himſelf meaneth? that which he calls our Legal, or that which he calls our Evangelical righteouſneſſe? or both? If the firſt, Chriſt made Righteouſnes to us, this is indeed the righteouſneſs, the whole, and ſole righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Goſpel righteouſneſs which we have given to us unto Juſtification, a righteouſneſs without us, which admits not of degrees: And this righteouſneſs is fully given us in this life, and not reſerved to be given us in the day of Judgement. This [<hi>muſt</hi>] we are content Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould put upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, that in this ſenſe we muſt underſtand our Divines. But

Not the former, for Chriſt, whole Chriſt (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) is the righteouſneſs given in this life. Neither will he, I ſuppoſe, affirme that we ſhall have a doubled Chriſt, or two Chriſts given us for righteouſneſs at the laſt judgement: Nor the latter; For I will not entertain ſo ſlanderous a thought of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to thinke he will ſay, that God gives Chriſt but unperfectly and ſeemingly here, but there perfectly, and really: Nay hee gives Chriſt perfectly and really here; There he will but own and manifeſt his former gift, and grant.</p>

                        <p>I joyn together theſe three Aphoriſmes, partly becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth very little ſever them by the interpoſition of very ſhort Explications, which might have been as well ſpared as uſed, for any light they give to his Aphoriſms. But principally becauſe they all treat upon one, and the ſame Argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Juſtification.</p>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:167891:175"/>
                        <p>And here I could have deſired that he had treated more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatively, and leſs Magiſterially. That hee had ſtated the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which he here determines into Concluſions, and by the beſt Arguments he could, have aſſayed to prove his aſſertions, which he doth here nakedly, and peremptorily lay down only upon his own bare authority to be taken up, as if it were holy, and unerring. He could not have wanted help to have handled theſe points more controverſally, having the Papiſts on the one hand, and Arminians on the others, ſuggeſting matter, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to him, it being their, not Chriſts cauſe and doctrine, which he bids, and teacheth here to ſtand alone; ſo that in caſe he had met with a learned adverſary that had driven him out of this field, he might have been ſure to have been ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a whole brigade of theſe Sophiſters, that would either have laid in the place, or recovered the field for him again. But we muſt give leave to a man that is all wiſdome, ſometimes for his recreation to be ſervant to his will: And becauſe we find him not here what we expected, we muſt take him as he offers himſelf—<hi>Stet pro ratione voluntas.</hi> Only I think it fit to ſave the labour to anſwer Arguments, when he refuſeth to make it his task to bring them: Bare negations of Concluſions being the beſt way of anſwering, where they are peremptorily, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuouſly poſited, without any premiſſed reaſons from whence to draw them, or following arguments to back them. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith aſſerted, not proved, <hi>Jack Straws negation</hi> being of equal validity to <hi>John Scotus</hi> his affirmation; onely we ſhall view his words, to ſee what ſhew of reaſon there may be found in them.</p>
                        <p>In the Explication of the firſt of theſe three Poſitions, <hi>vizt.</hi> the 43. He tels us, <hi>This needs not explication.</hi> He ſaw it, and had acquaintance with it while it was yet but a notion in his brain, therefore needs not any ſpectacles to clear up unto him his own formed of spring; but for my part, ſuch is my dulneſs, that whether I ſeek for his meaning in ſome part of the Poſition, or for truth in the reſt, I profeſſe my ſelf unable to underſtand without an interpreter. Let his words be not onely glanced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but well conſidered, I might think there may be the like, though not ſo great an incapacity in anothers braine, as in mine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Juſtification</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which we have in Chriſts own Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:167891:176"/> is but conditional as to the particular offenders.</hi> Let the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wit here inform my ſtupidneſs what he meanes by the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which wee have in Chriſts own Juſtification? What is Chriſts own juſtification? or what the juſtification which we have in Chriſts own juſtification? If we underſtand not what the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a propoſition is, we cannot judge at all of the truth of the propoſition, and do in vain enquire into the predicate. We can go no further underſtandingly in this Theſis untill wee underſtand this, of which all the reſt ſpeaketh. Chriſts own juſtification may be underſtood actively or paſſively: For the juſtification by which hee juſtifieth others, or that by which God hath juſtified him. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had meant the former, I conceive he would have ſaid plainly (as he doth every where elſe) <hi>Juſtification,</hi> without adding to it <hi>Chriſts,</hi> or <hi>Chriſts own,</hi> which ſeems to be uſed to diſtinguiſh here between the juſtification here ſpoken of, and the common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification whereof he treateth throughout this Tractate. If in the latter ſenſe, it may not ſuddenly appear, how poſſibly we can bee juſtified in Chriſts own juſtification. Neither can Chriſts own juſtification properly taken, be poſsibly made our juſtification: For all will apprehend (without help) by Chriſts own juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the juſtification proper to his perſon, which none had, or have in common with him. Yet I conceive Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means here Chriſts paſsive juſtification, Gods juſtifying of Chriſt; and that theſe words here do relate to the words which he hath within the 4 number of the foregoing, or 42 Theſis, where he ſaith [4. <hi>His own Juſtification as the publick perſon at his reſurrection.</hi>] which is not enough properly called Chriſts own, becauſe it is not the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Chriſt as perſonally alone, but as myſtically conſidered.</p>
                        <p>Taking this to be his meaning, I ſhall firſt ſpeak ſomething of the meaning of the phraſe, and then examine the truth of the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. For the meaning of the phraſe; As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained the office of a publick perſon in relation to that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of not eating of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge of good and evil, ſo that if he had obeyed we had all lived, and been juſtified in him; but in his diſobedience we all ſinned, and were condemned in him: So alſo Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in making ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice upon the croſs ſuſtained the office of a publick perſon, ſtood in the room of all the Elect, bare their ſins as imputed to him, ſo that they all in him did their law, were in him crucified, dead, and buried, and ſuffered the paines of hell it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:167891:176"/> ſelf. And as he was a publick perſon in his ſuffering, ſo alſo was he in his reſurrection; having paid the utmoſt farthing of our debt, he roſe to receive a full acquittance, or juſtification in his own, and our names for all the ſinnes for which, and all the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which he had ſuffered for us, and we in him. The juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and acquittance then given him, and to us in his name by the Father, is that which (out of doubt) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls Chriſts own juſtification, yet was not his own ſo, but that it was every elect perſons in him.</p>
                        <p>Having the meaning of the phraſe, let us now enquire into the truth, or falſhood of the Poſition. <hi>The Juſtification</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>which we have in Chriſts own Juſtification, is but conditional as to the particular offenders, and none can lay claim to it till hee have performed the conditions, nor shall any be perſonally juſtified till then: Even the Elect,</hi> &amp;c. Hee ſaith much, and audaciouſly (as all may ſee) but how ſtrongly doth hee prove it? <hi>For confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> (ſaith hee in the Explic.) <hi>there is enough ſaid under the 15, 18, 19, 20 Poſitions before.</hi>) And I anſwer, how valid and pertinent to his purpoſe that <hi>Enough</hi> which hee there ſaid is, I there examined: And becauſe he brings here no new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I may juſtly paſſe it by without giving any further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                        <p>Onely it ſhall not bee impertinent to take notice how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly hee layes downe every clauſe of this Poſition, to corrupt with an evill ſenſe whom hee can, and to evade with the pretext of a good meaning where he cannot deceive, if eſpied, and queſtioned.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When he ſaith this Juſtification is conditional as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular offenders, &amp; none can lay claim, &amp;c. Though by the whole frame of this his Treatiſe, it is enough evident that he means what he ſpeaks in the worſt ſenſe; yet his words leave it here doubtful, whether he means that our Juſtification which we have in Chriſts juſtification be conditional<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Chriſt hath received it in his, or our names; or as he having received it for us, doth offer it to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar offendors upon conditions, upon the performance whereof they ſhall have it, with the fruit, and comfort thereof decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and evidenced to their own ſoules. Though the former bee his ſenſe, yet knowing with what arguments hee may be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; That there was an abſolute, and not a conditional payment made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which not a conditional, but an abſolute diſcharge is due.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:167891:177"/> That Chriſt as a publick perſon ſtanding in our ſtead, received the ſame juſtification for himſelfe and us, from all the ſinnes that had been imputed both to him and us: but that he received for himſelf not a conditional, but an abſolute Juſtification; therefore for us alſo. That if particular offendors be but conditionally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in Chriſt, then are they not at all actually, and really juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt, and ſo the fruit of Chriſts death being ſuſpended, upon conditions, may be none at all, in caſe none performe the conditions. That it is againſt the ſtream of the Goſpel, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that even <hi>upon the croſs he hath cancelled, or blotted out the hand-writing, ſpoiled the principalities and powers,</hi> Col. 2. 14, 15. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>purged the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works, by his blood,</hi> Heb. 9. 13, 14. <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world</hi> (while the world) <hi>to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>and made us accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. And all this, before we had a being perſonally, therefore before we performed any conditions. Knowing (I ſay) how he might be overwhelmed with arguments from the Scriptures by our Divines, as hee hath read far more copiouſly then I have time here to particularize, in their works againſt the Papiſts and Arminians, and might have been more preſſed and multiplyed againſt himſelf; and that Truth is not onely unconquerable, but victorious: To prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, he leaves a hole by which to eſcape, <hi>viz.</hi> Hee meant not thus: But that our Juſtification is conditional as to our claim of right therein, we are not perſonally juſtified, have not our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs declared, and evidenced to our own conſciences till we perform the conditions. Such ſincerity and integrity is there in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrines.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When he ſaith, <hi>None can lay claim to Juſtification untill he have performed the conditions, nor ſhall be perſonally juſtified till then,</hi> he leaves it ambiguous whether he mean till his faith, obedience, and good works (which with him are the conditions) be in <hi>fieri,</hi> or elſe in <hi>factum eſſe,</hi> be begun, or elſe finiſhed, and perfected, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or elſe fully done. His phraſe directly points out the latter, &amp; the whole ſtream of his diſputations in this Book concurs with it. Neither is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſuch an <hi>A, B, C, darian</hi> that he need to bee taught to ſpeak Grammatically, and to deliver in proper termes his own dictates, that we ſhould think him to ſpeak more, or leſſe then he meaneth, ſaving when he will doe ſo for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Unleſſe therefore he meant in the latter ſenſe, and would
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:167891:177"/> be ſo underſtood, hee would give no advantage by his words to any ſo to underſtand him. This being then his meaning, he leaves us yet in doubt whether he joynes with the Papiſts here, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that it is poſſible to attain perfection of righteouſneſs, and ſo to have fully performed all obedience in this life, thereby me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting Juſtification, ſo winning it at the hardeſt, before he wear it, as we have found him in, and under his 23, 24, 26, 27, Theſes, maintaining enough fully behind the curtaine; or elſe with the Arminians, in holding that no man is juſtified in this life, and ſo confounding Juſtification and Glorification either with the other, an aſſertion worſe then Popiſh, wholly contradicting the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea not to ſtay particularizing the whole ſum of the Goſpel, but becauſe both Papiſts and Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are his cabinet friends, that he might pleaſe both, and offend neither, it ſufficeth him to ſhew himſelf an adverſary to the truth, wherein he hath them both confederates with him, and either with the other; it being no difficulty for him to cloſe with both that differ but in words a little, but are one in ſubſtance, like <hi>Sampſons Foxes hung together by the tails in a firebrand, though their faces look ſeveral waies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. I might no leſs diſcover his ſubtilty in that ambiguous term of Perſonal Juſtification, as he oppoſeth it to Conditional Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Chriſt, how many ſenſes it may bear, and ſcarce ever a good one; yet in the ambiguity of the phraſe, a way left him to evade.</p>
                        <p>The 44 Theſis is ridiculous to all that deſire to ſpeak after the wiſdome of God, and not after the fallacies of men that are meere fooliſhneſſe with God. <hi>Men that are but thus conditionally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and juſtified, may be unpardoned and unjustified again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut ſuprà.</hi> In this at laſt Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is not to be deprived of his due praiſe; that he makes his foundation and building to conſiſt of homogeneous Materialls: an imaginary foundation, and a phantaſticall building. It is as much as if he had ſaid, A fancied ſomething made up of nothing, may without the ſpilling of much blood or ſweat, be reſolved into nothing again. The Cat in the Fable, which <hi>Venus</hi> turned into a fair Virgin, becauſe ſhe would not leave to hunt mice, was quickly reformed into a Cat again. If one dream make Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> a Holy Pope, the next
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:167891:178"/> dream may unpope and unhallow him again. And men that were but conditionally juſtified, may be unjuſtified again, and be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as well juſtified while unjuſtified, as when conditionally juſtified, and as fully pardoned while unpardoned, as when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally pardoned; and all the debt as fully required at their hands when it is conditionally forgiven, as when it is unforgiven again. <hi>And all this without any change in God, or in his lawes.</hi> For all theſe are not Gods, but Maſter <hi>Baxters,</hi> and his Arminians, and Jeſuits juſtifications, and Non-Juſtifications pardonings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonings, forgiving debts and requiring them again. <hi>God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable, His gifts and calling without Repentance.</hi> Rom. 11. 29. But theſe are <hi>Protei and Chamelions,</hi> (ſpecially when the change is from evill to worſe) and would feign to themſelves and us a God like to themſelves, that ſhould be a changeable God, no God.</p>
                        <p>It behoved Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> to have proved from Scriptures this Popiſh Arminian Doctrine of conditionall juſtifying, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the word, that it might appear to us that the Oracles of God, and not the Sophiſtry of men had drawn him into this Topſie turnie tattle, rather than Doctrine of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Not doing this, his breath ſmells of a Pope in his belly; That his aim is to make the word of God to ſtrike ſaile to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms of the Papiſts and Arminians, and not theſe to the word. For ſo he proceeds in the next, which is the 45 Theſis in their language.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Yea in Caſe the juſtified by faith ſhould ceaſe believing, the Scripture would pronounce them unjuſt again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Juſtification doth continue conditional as long as they live here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they ſhould ceaſe to be believers, they would ceaſe to be juſtified.</q>
                        <p>If the Heavens fall, we ſhall need no hobbies to catch larkes. If Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ceaſe to be a man, he will ceaſe to be an Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. They are ſuppoſitions of things poſſible, or impoſſible, which in both theſe his Theſes he maketh: if of poſſibles, why doth he not prove them? if of impoſſibles, what can he aim at but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them that are made to be taken, and the deſtroying of the peace of tender and infirme conſciences? Hee turnes us over in the former poſition to <hi>Ball</hi> of the Covenant. I have it not. But if there he be the ſame <hi>Ball</hi> with <hi>Ball</hi> of Faith, there is no more agreement betweene <hi>Ball</hi> and <hi>Bax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> than betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Belial.</hi> I heard indeed long ſince, that this Maſter <hi>Ball</hi>
                           <pb n="299" facs="tcp:167891:178"/> ſeeing faſhionableneſſe and formality tending ſomewhat to the Popiſh Outſideneſſe in Religion was the way to preferment, had before his death ſomewhat declined. But unleſſe I ſaw grounds for ſuch a thought I cannot entertain it, ſo great an eſtimation both of his ableneſſe and holineſſe hath his Treatiſe of Faith left in me. But if otherwiſe, it is not unnaturall to a <hi>Ball</hi> to roll, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially down the hill. And we halt not between two opinions, we have the Lord, and not <hi>Baal</hi> for our God.</p>
                        <p>But Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot put upon us this bull, that he ſhould with a trick of the hand beguile us into an opinion, that in this Doctrine he is a follower of <hi>Baal.</hi> Nay firſt his popiſh School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Jeſuits have taught him, and then <hi>Arminius,</hi> and his followers have poliſhed him; ſo that in theſe two Theſes he doth but ſpeak parat-like, even word for word after theſe his Maſters; as I could (if there were need) alleadge cut of the Authors whom he followeth. Yea further, the more antient Schoolmen, and the moſt learned and Metaphyſicall among the Jeſuits, blow off as baſely derogatory from the perfection of Gods Nature, the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy poſitions which he here layeth down as Articles of Faith, which he doth not at all apply himſelfe to prove, as if they were unqueſtionable becauſe his quill hath dropt them.</p>
                        <p>He ſees his Doctrine in theſe 2 Theſes, ſuch as either hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but words in it, or if any thing reall, ſuch as tendeth to the advancing of the Popiſh and Arminian Doctrines of Univerſall Redemption, Freewill, falling from Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats his reader [in the Explication] to ſuſpend his judgement till another Tractate of his about univerſall Redemption come forth, which in the Poſtſcript to theſe Aphoriſms he tels us he is not certain whether it will be ever; and in his Append. pag. 164. ſeems to conclude that it will be never: And that, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, is upon Saint Juſtifications day, according to the <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> account. And in caſe it bring no better ſavour of Chriſt with it then this his Tractate, better then, then ſooner. To which time alſo if he had ſuſpended the publication of this book, I doubt not he might have obtained more then a conditional Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from the guilt of ſuch a ſuſpenſion.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>For that which intimates the falling away of the juſtified,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſpeaks onely upon ſuppoſition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but doth beleeve that the juſtified by Faith never do, nor ſhall fall away.</hi> ibid. Explic. A larger profeſſion in reſpect to this Article of his Creed, then I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:167891:179"/> expected from him, if it be ſingle and hath no flaw of rottenneſſe and deceit in it. But when we have found him calling the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of judgement in the laſt day, juſtification by Faith, as well as that which is in this life in title of Law, (as he terms it) pag. 185. and makes the juſtification in this life to be meerly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and conſequently either nul or reverſible, in theſe 44, &amp; 45 Theſ. what can we think can be his meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the juſtified by faith never do, or ſhall fall away;</hi> but this, that they that are ſentenced once to life in the day of judgement, and already glorified, neither doe, nor ſhall fall away. And yet for him that holds our juſtification to be ſtil but conditional un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of judgement, it would (I think) be a harder task to prove that it remains not conditional after the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for the truly Orthodox in this point to prove it to be in this life abſolute and unconditional. Were I the man that were fit to undertake ſuch a diſpute, I ſhould (as I conceive) have a great advantage againſt ſuch an adverſary; for moſt of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which he ſhould bring to prove the abſoluteneſs and immutability of juſtification in the Kingdom of glory, would ſtrengthen againſt himſelf the ſame abſoluteneſs and immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of juſtification in the Kingdome of grace. And almoſt all that he ſhould be able to anſwer for the eluding of my arguments againſt abſolute juſtification above, would ſtrengthen me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his arguments againſt abſolute juſtification here. But I hold it altogether unproper to make ſo holy a thing the ſubject of ludicrous exercitations. The Scripture is as full to prove the Saints perſeverance in grace here, as their perſeverance in glory above, and as poſſible is the falling from the latter as from the former.</p>
                        <p>Now before I wholly paſs from theſe poſitions of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to make way for the examination of other Poſitions of his which I ſhall annex to theſe in this Chapter, becauſe of the neer affinity of their matter with that which is contained in theſe: I ſhall ſpeak ſomething in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> univerſall conditional Juſtification in Chriſt, or (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> termes it) in Chriſts own Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then, whatſoever ſins, of whatſoever perſons were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto Chriſt, and for which he hath made full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods Juſtice, theſe are no more imputed, but forever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Chriſt abſolutely, and unconditionally to them who
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:167891:179"/> were the committers thereof. But all the ſinnes of all the elect, and of them onely, and not of the world, were imputed to Chriſt, and hee hath made full ſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The propoſition is clear, unleſs we will pronounce God unjuſt: For if he ſhould impute to the offender any one ſin which was imputed to Chriſt, and for which Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, then ſhould God bee unjuſt in taking vengeance twice of the ſame ſin, once from Chriſt, and another time from the offender, contrary to the both equity of his juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of his truth, in either of which it is unpoſſible for God to fail. Or if any ſhould ſay that their ſins were but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally imputed to Chriſt, and that he made but a conditional ſatisfaction for them, this were totally to deny the truth, and reality of Chriſts ſufferings. It was not a conditional, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and real ſatisfaction that he made to divine Juſtice; they were real ſtripes, real and abſolute wounds, groans, torments, death-pangs, by which he ſatisfied Juſtice: He was not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, but verily <hi>made fin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>himſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>was wounded for our tranſgreſſion, bruiſed for our iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5. When all this was done abſolutely, and really, and ſo a real, and abſolute condition made, ſhall all this produce only a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and not a real and abſolute juſtification in Chriſt to, and for them who in him have made abſolute ſatisfaction, ſo that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in themſelves muſt make abſolute ſatisfaction again? This poſſibly may agree with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Juſtice, but never with the Juſtice of God. The aſſumption is thus proved, as to his bearing, and ſatisfying for the ſins of the Elect only, and not of the world. He ſuffered not for ſuch as we call <hi>Individua vaga,</hi> certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain perſons, himſelf not knowing who they were, or ſhould be. <hi>The High Prieſt, that typifyed him,</hi> offered not his ſacrifices at adventures for he knew not whom, <hi>but bare the names of them for whom he offered, before the Lord,</hi> Exo. 28. 9, 10, 11, 12, 29. And this was to be fulfilled in Chriſt their Antitype. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and know my ſheep.</hi> Joh. 10. 11, 14, 15. <hi>For the ſheep onely, for them whom he knew to be his ſheep,</hi> he layd downe his life. And leſt any ſhould think hee ſpeakes here onely of his called, and not his elect ones, he addeth, <hi>Other ſheep alſo I have which are not of this fold,</hi> i. e. of Iſrael; but of the Gentiles, <hi>them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice. They are his ſheep,</hi>
                           <pb n="306" facs="tcp:167891:180"/> and he layeth down his life for them, to ſatisfie for their ſins before they were beleeving, before they were in being, and brings them home by the voice of his Goſpel afterward, ver. 16. But to the unbeleeving Jews he ſaith, <hi>Ye beleeve not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>Firſt ſheep</hi> purged, and redeemed by the blood of the Shepheard, and then beleevers afterward. And if not ſheep firſt, then unbeleevers forever. Neither ſaith he, ye are not my ſheep juſtified and reconciled by my death, becauſe ye beleeve not; but <hi>ye beleeve not becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, in the number of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and juſtified ones.</hi> Juſtification, abſolute juſtification in Chriſt, ſtill goeth before faith in the ſo juſtified. Again for them all, and onely, did Chriſt as our Prieſt offer himſelf in ſacrifice, for whom as our Prieſt he offered prayers to God when the offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was at hand; but he ſo offered his prayers, <hi>not for the world, but for them which God had given him,</hi> i. e. the elect, Joh. 17. 9. So in this part the Aſſumption ſtands firme; on the other part, that he bare and ſatisfied for all the ſinnes of all the Elect, is plain; <hi>The blood of Chriſt purgeth from all ſinne,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. <hi>by one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. When it is ſaid they are perfected forever, it is included that there remaines not one ſinne unſatisfied for. And this is the priviledge of all the Elect, of all the Sheep both in being, and in futurition, both within, and without the fold, as before was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If Chriſt hath purchaſed, and we receive in this life onely an univerſall conditionall Juſtification: It will follow alſo that God hath in himſelf decreed before all time onely ſuch a juſtification to men; and conſequently that he neither loved, nor elected to life them that are ſaved more then the damned: For the <hi>Son was in the boſom of the Father,</hi> therefore privy to his ſecret will, to his very boſom counſels, <hi>came down from heaven not to tranſgreſſe, but to fulfill his will,</hi> Joh. 6. 38. &amp; 4. 34. &amp; 5. 30. <hi>was faithfull to him that appointed him,</hi> &amp;c.

Upon as good grounds as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth in the enſuing part of this Treatiſe argue from ſalvation or glorification to juſtification, might I alſo argue from juſtification to ſalvation, that if juſtification be univerſally conditionall, ſo is ſalvation or glorification alſo; that if one, then both run upon theſe terms <hi>dum bene ſe geſſerit,</hi> if he beleeve and obey he ſhall be juſtifyed and glorifyed, if not, neither ſhall be his protion. And when any is juſtifyed and glorifyed, his perſeverance in that ſtate depends upon his freewill, runs upon the ſame condition ſtill, ſo long juſtifyed and glorifyed as he is willing and obedient, if he ceaſe to obey he ſhall be unjuſtifyed and unglorifyed again. And thus all the fruits of Chriſts death ſhall be rolled to nothing, and Chriſt righteoſuneſſe and glory ſhall be a conditionall and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table righteouſneſſe and glory, to day in ſplendor, to morrow in darkneſſe, and himſelf become a conditionall Saviour, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall King, at one time compleat and ſitting among his golden Candleſticks, in the midſt of his glorious Temple; at another unchriſted, unkinged; a head without a body and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, a Saviour of nobodies, a King without ſubjects; ſome not at all ſubmitting to his golden ſcepter, the reſt that have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted revolting from him, ſome from the kingdome of grace, ſome from the kingdome of glory, as <hi>Adam</hi> from Paradiſe, the Angels from heaven, ſo that he ſhall be left alone, and his ſufferings and merits loſe all their fruit by means of this conditionall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: There is I confeſſe no weight in this Argument as to the truly Orthodox. But it holds as firme to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as his Arguments can hold to us about conditionall juſtification in Chriſts juſtification.</p>
                        <p>If he object, that the Saints in the kingdome of glory ſhall be ſo confirmed that they ſhall not fall away.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall anſwer, ſo are the Saints alſo in the kingdome of grace, and are as abſolutely fixed therein, upon the truth, love and power of God in Chriſt, as the triumphant Saints in the kingdome of glory. I doubt not to prove the one as ſoundly as he can prove the other.</p>
                        <p>I ceaſe further to enlarge my ſelf in Arguments to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. That which I have ſaid being (as I before mentioned) ſpoken, not ſo much to prove an abſolute, and to ſhew the vanity of a conditionall juſtification by Chriſt, as to make way to that which comes after to be handled.</p>

                        <p>From the 45 then I paſſe to the 55 <hi>Theſis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> becauſe whatſoever there is in the interpoſed poſitions worthy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, either hath been or will come to be conſidered in a place more convenient. Only by the way we ſhall take a ſhort view of what he hath in and under the 54 <hi>Theſis;</hi> it runnes thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 209.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> Remiſſian, Juſtification and Reconciliation, do but reſtore the offender into the ſame state of freedome and favour that he fell from, but adoption and marriage union with Chriſt, do advance him far higher.</q>
                        <p>Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives me occaſion to put up ſome Quaeries to him.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether remiſſion, juſtification and reconciliation are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent termes ſignifying one and the ſame thing in ſubſtance, or ſo many diſtinct things differing each from other as well in ſenſe as in ſound? If differing things, wherein doth the difference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? he anſwers in the explication,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> The freedome from obligation to puniſhment is called Remiſſion; the freedome from accuſation and condemnation is called Juſtification; and the freedome from enmity and diſpleaſure is called Reconciliation.</q>
                        <p>Theſe are all at once, but he ſaith, not [<hi>all one.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Excellently diſtinguiſhed, as he that divided the word [malt] into four parts. But doth not every of theſe words imply all thoſe freedomes? doth not remiſſion free as well from accuſation, condemnation and enmity, as from obligation to puniſhment? And doth not reconciliation free from obligation to puniſhment and from condemnation as well as from enmity and diſpleaſure? And doth not juſtification likewiſe do all as well as one? I know no abſurdity to aſſert that the ſame freedome is in divers reſpects, but in the ſame ſenſe (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> well expreſſeth) called by all<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ameſ. Med. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 27. §. 22.</note> theſe names. As the ſtate of ſin from which we are freed, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſtate of ſubjection to puniſhment or vengeance, ſo this freedome is called Remiſſion. As the ſame ſtate is conſidered as enmity againſt God, ſo is it called Reconciliation. As the ſame ſtate is conſidered as a ſtate of ſin and condemnation, ſo the ſame freedome from it is called Juſtification; and this alſo ſo, that juſtification is all theſe, remiſſion all, and reconciliation all, and neither any thing effectually if it be not all. All together make up one act of God by his Goſpell, and may (as I conceive more properly be called Gods act or acts [in their active ſenſe]
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:167891:181"/> then concomitant conſequents of one and the ſame act of God. Beſides if he take them for three differing things, I would aske him whether there be any myſterie in the order wherein he placeth them? Whether firſt we have remiſſion of ſins, then juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from condemnation, and then at laſt reconciliation? I ſpeak of priority and poſteriority in order, notin time, for ſo he ſaith they are concomitants and at once. If ſome ſuch myſtery, I would be enformed, whether by reconciliation he mean the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of our love to God, or of Gods love to us? if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, how can our love (as he teacheth) be a condition of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if in order it be not before but after juſtification? if the latter, then it ſeems Gods love is not the cauſe of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (ſeeing it doth in order follow it) but that our love to God is the cauſe and ground of it.</p>
                        <p>Or if he put theſe three as <hi>Synonyma</hi>'s for one and the ſame thing, why doth he then ſo curiouſly diſtinguiſh; and (as it were) give to them, their ſeverall differencing forms, as we find him to do?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Whether he take them for the ſame or divers things, I enquire whether they be antecedents or conſequents of our union with Chriſt? If antecedents, whether it be poſſible for a man to be juſtifyed in the way of the new Covenant (for of this juſtification Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaketh) being yet out of Chriſt? or how is he then juſtifyed by faith, charity, and good works; except it be by a legall faith, charity and works? and if legall, how are theſe then our Goſpell righteouſneſſe? or have they Goſpell righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which are not in Chriſt? Or if conſequents of our union with Chriſt, whether then they do not preſuppoſe our union with Chriſt? and if ſo, whether the juſtifyed in Chriſt are not advanced to a far higher ſtate of freedome and honour by their being found righteous in Chriſt, then they loſt by being found ſinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> and whether their union with Chriſt be not the common foundation both of juſtification and adoption? Or laſtly is his meaning, that <hi>our union with Chriſt is the foundation not only of remiſſion, juſtification and reconciliation, which do reſtore the offender into the ſame ſtate of freedome and favor which we had loſt, and faln from: but alſo of Adoption and of a far higher advancement then that from which he fell?</hi> herein I ſhall not diſſent from him. But why then doth he ſo tranſpoſe his words as to make the ſtream of Gods operations to run backward, if not to make mans quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:167891:182"/> the ground of his union with Chriſt, his faith and good works by which he is juſtifyed to be if not the cauſe, yet the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of this union, and not this union to be the cauſe or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of his both juſtification and holineſſe? So much I thought fit to interpoſe here, that this <hi>Theſis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might not ſerve as a bridge to carry over the reader captive unto ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious untruths in the after-part of this his Tractate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Hence now let us paſſe to the 55 <hi>Theſis,</hi> which hath not a totall diſagreement with the former that have been examined in this Chapter, but a dependence upon them.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <label>B. Theſis 55.</label> p. 211. Before it be committed it is no ſin, and where there is no ſin the penalty is not due, and where it is not due, it cannot properly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; therefore ſin is not forgiven before it be committed, though the grounds of certain remiſſion be laid before.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>The ſtrength and evidence of this reaſoning will the better appear if we lay by it another to the ſame tune and upon the ſame terms. It cannot be denyed to be as good an argumentation as this, if I ſhould thus argue. <hi>Before it be committed it is no ſin, and where there is no ſin, there is no penalty due, and where it is not due, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be required; therefore the ſins that have been committed ſince the death of Chriſt, had not their penalty born by Chriſt, before they were committed, and conſequently, Gods juſtice remains unſatisfyed for the ſins of all, that have been committed ſince the death of Chriſt, and every offender is to bear the condemnation of them in his own boſome, though the grounds of certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were laid before</hi> [in God] <hi>except another Chriſt be ſent from heaven to bear, or the ſame Chriſt again to bear the penalty of the ſins after they are committed.</hi> Whether this argumentation doth not carry in it as great, if not greater, likelihood of reaſon then Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> I leave to every rationall man to judge. And thus when a proud luſt poſſeſſeth us to reaſon from our own brain and not from Gods word, we eaſily reaſon our ſelves into hell.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I ſee how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> according to this reaſoning can ever look to be juſtifyed or ſaved, except by one of theſe two wayes, either by aſſerting his own righteouſneſſe (which hitherto with his fellowes) he hath made but a collaterall with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt to juſtifie and ſave) to be at a pinch all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and effectuall to perfect the work without Chriſt; as it is with partners in a Trade, and buying and ſelling of wares, what one doth both do, and what bargain one makes both muſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:167891:182"/> ſtand to it: Or elſe by canonizing the Popiſh maſſe, to offer therein Chriſt often unto God as a ſacrifice for the expiation and forgiveneſſe of his ſins when he hath committed them, ſith Chriſts offering himſelf was in no wiſe the bearing of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſatisfying of Gods juſtice, for his or our ſins, becauſe not then committed.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſee whether in any ſenſe the reaſoning of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here, may be made good or taken up as tolerable. Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here Gods forgiving of ſins as an act immanent in God from eternity. For this would but make Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtartle, he is no more patient to hear this voice, then was <hi>Caligula</hi> at the voice of Thunder; his bloud riſeth at it, as do theirs at the ſight of a Cat whoſe natures have an antipathy to that poor creature that never meant them hurt: Let us conſider forgiveneſſe and pardon in tearms and wayes as himſelf granteth a poſſibility of giving and receiving it. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>in foro conſcientiae</hi> at the bar of God in the conſcience of man, to which he moſt limiteth and contracteth remiſſion and juſtification. May not the offender apprehend and apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the pardon of his future (as well as of his paſt and preſent) ſins through the Lord Chriſt in ſome ſenſe?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the ſeed of all the ſins which he ſhall through infirmity commit in the time to come of his life, I mean his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature or originall defilement and ſin, from which as from their naturall ſource, all their acts of ſin ſpring, every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is, and may apprehend himſelf pardoned; this the very Papiſts acknowledge, denying originall ſin and defectiveneſſe to have any mortality of ſin in it, becauſe the guilt thereof is purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſoul by the bloud of Chriſt at his very firſt admiſſion and entrance into Chriſt, (as they ſay) In this reſpect I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will confeſſe that all their after acts of ſin are remitted (in their ſeed and womb) to beleevers before they be committed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reſpect of Gods not imputing them to the perſon that ſhall offend, ſo the ſins not yet committed are forgiven to every elect perſon. God hath laid on Chriſts ſcore all the ſins of the elect, committed or to be committed, and ſatisfyed his juſtice for them upon Chriſt, who in their names hath paid the penalty of all, therefore their conſciences are diſcharged, neither ſins paſt nor ſins to come ſhall be any more imputed to them. <hi>There is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:167891:183"/> no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8. 1. There is dayly new ſinning, why not alſo ſubjection to condemnation? becauſe the perſon being in Chriſt, though ſubject to a neceſſity of ſinning, yet through the juſtification of his perſon is exempted from the further imputation of ſin ſo committed unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; <hi>He that beleeveth hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, Joh.</hi> 5. 24. He comes dayly into the acting of new ſins; how is it that he comes not into a ſubjection and obligation to condemnation by thoſe ſins but becauſe they were forgiven to the offender before, therefore not imputed to him when committed? It is one chief priviledge of the new Covenant, <hi>Their ſins and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will I remember no more. Now where remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more offering for ſin? Jer.</hi> 31. 38. &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 17, 18. ſpeaks the holy Ghoſt here only of ſin paſt and not of thoſe to come, that they which are within the new Covenant, have remiſſion of them? then</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſame perſon hath ſome ſins forgiven and ſome not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by Chriſt, that which is paſt is remitted, that which is to come is retained.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Then the priviledge is no priviledge, if only ſins paſt are not remembred, but ſins to come are kept in Gods memory to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them every moment as faſt as they are committed: For one of theſe laſt milſtones tyed to the neck of the poor offender, ſinks him into hell as ſurely as if all that are removed had their weight returned upon him with that one to ſink him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If God hath remitted and juſtifyed a beleever from the ſins which he hath committed, and not from the ſins which he foreknoweth they will commit, but imputeth or will impute them, then is the ſame perſon both juſtifyed and unjuſtifyed at the ſame time, and God at the ſame time both loveth the ſame perſon to eternall life, and hateth him to eternall condemnation: which were no leſſe abſurdity then to attribute two contrary wils acting in God at once, and ſo the ſame perſon be declared in his own conſcience at the ſame time both in the ſtate of life, and in the ſtate of death; of life, in reſpect of the ſins paſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given through Chriſt; of death, in regard of the ſins to come not yet forgiven.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In Chriſt, or (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> terms it <hi>Theſis</hi> 43.) in Chriſts own juſtification, either all ſins are forgiven to the elect or none at all. When having done their Law, and paid their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:167891:183"/> debt, Chriſt appeared in the <hi>moſt holy place,</hi> in the heaven at <hi>Gods mercy ſeat to mediate</hi> with his bloud for them, he either received acquitance from, and forgiveneſſe of all the ſins which his elect in after times ſhould commit, and ſo in Chriſt their ſins to come were forgiven, or elſe no ſin was forgiven; for as yet they were not in being, therefore neither were their ſins yet committed. But he received then in their names a full acquitance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of their ſins as hath been before ſhewed, therefore of their ſins before they were committed, and they were forgiven before they had offended. Hence ſome of our Divines thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if ſince Chriſts ſatisfaction any ſins be imputed any more to the elect, they muſt be ſuch as Chriſt hath or hath not expiated with his bloud, and made ſatisfaction for to Gods juſtice; if ſuch as Chriſt hath expiated, then notwithſtanding that God imputes the ſin, yet the perſon to whom he imputes it is in grace and favour with God, and the full penalty of his ſin (while imputed) is paid to God: but this were injuſtice not incident to God to impute a debt which is fully paid him. If ſuch as Chriſt hath not ſatisfyed for, then the faith of an elect perſon obtains at Gods hands forgiveneſſe, or the not imputing of ſuch ſins, for which Chriſt hath not ſatisfyed Gods juſtice, and ſo there ſhall be here remiſſion without the ſhedding of bloud, and juſtification out of Chriſt; or faith and Goſpell obedience ſhall be the price and ranſome of their ſoules: All which is moſt abſurd. Therefore, the ſins of the elect yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed, are in Chriſt as fully forgiven, as thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> meaning be when he ſaith [the ſin is not forgiven before it be committed] that the beleever hath not a ſingular apprehenſion of the forgiveneſſe of every ſingular ſin before it be committed, and that God hath not declared to his conſcience the forgiveneſſe of every ſingular offence, <hi>i. e.</hi> this evill which at this, and that evill which in that hour of his life he ſhall drop into: I acknowledge in this ſenſe neither are any of our ſins future forgiven, nor many of our ſins paſt. For who in this caſe knoweth (not only how oft he ſhall erre, but alſo how oft and wherein he hath erred? in this reſpect the generall pardon ſealed in Chriſt bloud to us, though it mention not every ſingular errour of our lives contained under the generall, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for us.</p>

                        <p>But perhaps Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> meaning is, that Chriſt hath not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to the elect a plenary and abſolute forgiveneſſe, but hath conditionally dyed for all if they ſhall beleeve and obey, and upon this condition runs the hope of pardon as to the ſins which they ſhall commit unto their lives end; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſins being dayly pardoned upon the continuance and dayly renewing of their obedience, and ſo this <hi>Theſis</hi> runs in the ſame channell with the 43, 44, &amp; 45.

                        <p n="1">1 Perhaps ſome may except why he in aſſerting God to be the principall efficient cauſe of Juſtification, lets it paſſe ſo nakedly without an adjection of any of his attributes; ſo leaving it doubtfull whether it be the grace or the juſtice, the love or the hatred, the mercy or the wrath of God that is the efficient of Juſtification. We may eaſily anſwer our ſelves as to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, It is not Gods, but Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> juſtification whereof the cauſes are here aſſigned, ſuch as the Scriptures are unacquainted with, a juſtification of his own deviſing, defining and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, himſelf and none before himſelf (that I know) was in every point acquainted with it: No marvell then if he ſpeak differingly in ſetting forth the cauſes of his, from our Divines in laying down the cauſes of Gods juſtification. And indeed it is a difficult queſtion to determine whether his juſtification (if it were at all granted to be of God) might challenge more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the love or the hatred, the grace or the juſtice of God for its womb: It being a juſtification that leaves all men under the curſe, under the wrath of God, both in life and in death, untill the very day of Judgment, (as we have found him diſputing moſt profoundly in and under his 9. <hi>Theſis.</hi>) A juſtification that gives only a titular title without actuall and abſolute poſſeſſion of any greateſt or leaſt benefit to the juſtifyed, [which according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is the ſame thing as if we ſhould ſay to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifyed,] A juſtification more unpoſſible to be apprehended and held, then was the firſt juſtification by works, that was held forth upon poſſible tearms, exacting from a living man
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:167891:185"/> only continuance in the works of life; this upon unpoſſible (as reſpecting our preſent ſtate of infirmity) offering to a dead ſoul righteouſneſſe and life, upon condition the dead ſoul will quicken and ariſe from the dead to fetch it thence, whither if it come it muſt ſtill abide empty as it came, untill the day of Judgment, and then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will come again to tell us more of his minde whether it be at all attainable. I do not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury the man in ſaying he offers juſtification to a dead ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon condition the ſoul will quicken it ſelf. For let there be found but one clauſe in his whole book that implyeth a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and effuſion of grace from God, more to the quickning and juſtifying of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> then of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> of the damned then of the ſaved. Or what doth he leſſe that brings in works to juſtification, then deſtroy grace, to ſet up juſtification after the order and rule of ſtrict juſtice? Or when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſo exact in enumerating the <hi>Procatarcticall</hi> or outwardly moving cauſes; to what purpoſe doth he jumpe over the <hi>Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumene</hi> or inward moving cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace, love, and mercy which is within God himſelf, but to impriſon it in darkneſſe and eclipſe its glory, that mans righteouſneſſe might have the praiſe which pertains to God alone?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It may be alſo queſtioned, why amongſt all the cauſes of juſtification here aſſigned, there is no mention made of union and communion with Chriſt; when as our Divines following the rule of the Word, makes our union with him the very chief cauſe and ground of our being juſtifyed or declared to be juſtifyed according to the Goſpell juſtification, 1 <hi>Joh. 5: 12. Phil. 3. 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. and a multitude of other Scriptures which they alleadge, and if there were the leaſt need I might here quote a ſcore. What elſe but an evill eye, maligning the praiſe of God and of his Chriſt, ſuppreſſeth in ſilence and ſuffers not to appear in the chain of the cauſes of juſtification this link of union with Chriſt. Is it not that he will make our faith and works yet out of Chriſt the cauſe of our union with Chriſt, and not this the ground of the other?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 To come to thoſe queſtions which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwereth becauſe he conceives it will be expected.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. About the inſtrumentall cauſe, we queſtion not what he goes about to anſwer why he cals the promiſe or grant of the new Covenant, or the Goſpell, the inſtrumentall cauſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:167891:186"/> actively conſidered? but 1. Why he makes it the only inſtrumental cauſe, of juſtification howſoever conſidered? For this grant and promiſe doth by it ſelf no more juſtifie the beleevers then the infidels, the juſtifyed then the unjuſtifyed. Doth not God alſo make the ſpirit his inſtrument of juſtifying, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and unfolding the doctrine of the Goſpell, and evidencing and witneſſing to the ſoul remiſſion and juſtification, together with the love and grace of God from which this juſtification floweth? Why doth he ſtifle the working of the Spirit from having to do in this great work, except either with the Sadduces he denies the being, or with the Socinians the divinity and divine operation of the Spirit, or elſe to leave open a door to let in juſtification by the fleſh not by the Spirit, by the ſtrength of mans free will without the preventing helps of the Spirit of grace? Or as juſtification is taken paſſively for our being juſtifyed in our ſelves, why is not faith put as an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe alſo? But this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will anſwer anon, and I ſhall wait on him to hear how ſatisfactory his anſwer is.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether in his anſwer to the Queſtion as he puts it, when he makes a <hi>mans leaſe or deed of gift, and a Kings pardon</hi> to have their force <hi>from the hand and ſeal annexed to it,</hi> is it not much more implyed that the grant of the Goſpell without hand and ſeal put to it is not a ſufficient inſtrument to the juſtifying of any man. For the grant of the Goſpell is made to the world indefinitely, but when faith as the impreſſion of Gods hand upon the ſoul, and the Spirit witneſſing and ſealing to the conſcience thou art the perſon to whom the juſtification generally propoſed in the Goſpell doth particularly belong, and ſo are applyed by God as true acceſſary evidences to the grant of the Goſpell, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate juſtification upon the ſoul of man, can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> deny theſe being acts of God diſtinct from the word of promiſe, to be inſtrumentall to juſtification as properly and fully as the ſaid promiſe and grant?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To his <hi>Procatarctick cauſes</hi> which in the <hi>Theſis</hi> he giveth [<hi>viz. ſo far as God may be ſaid to be moved by any thing out of himſelf, ſpeaking after the manner of men,</hi> ſaith he] I aske</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Whether God may be moved in his will, by any thing out of himſelf? If ſo, whether then ſomething out of God do not give <hi>magis &amp; minus,</hi> increaſe and diminution to God? For every change of Gods will is a change of God himſelf, and what ſhall
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:167891:186"/> it avail any to be juſtifyed by a mutable God that to day will juſtifie, to morrow unjuſtifie againe, being apt to take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of change from things without him? yea if a God mutable, then in truth no God, but one of the Pagans Idols or Puppets. Or how little doth his additionall cauſe help him, [<hi>to ſpeake after the manner of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

If he ſay God cannot be moved by any thing out of himſelf, how can he excuſe himſelf from being a ſlanderer of the moſt high God, by deviſing and aſſerting here 4. cauſes out of God moving him to juſtifie us, having before wilfully ſuppreſſed in darkneſſe the riches of Gods grace within himſelf alſufficient without any auxiliary ſtrength from the creature to move him? How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous is he herein to the order of nature, making the fruit to bear the tree, and not the tree the fruit? What leſſe doth he in making Chriſts ſatisfaction and interceſſion, the ſinners ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and deſire of ſupply, and the opportunity or advantage, for the glorifying of his juſtice and mercie, the cauſes of Gods will, and gracious willings, when contrariwiſe Gods gracious will is the cauſe of all theſe?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Whether he jears at the invaluable means of our ſalvation, or elſe that he thinks himſelf matching cocks for the game, that he counterpoiſeth the higheſt perfections of Chriſts medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip with mans vanity? how unſufferable is it to ſee him putting into the one ſcale a precious pearl, into the other a pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percorn or cherry ſtone? To match Chriſts interceſſion with the ſinners ſupplication? To make the feebleneſſe of man, a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall and concauſe in the ſame order and degree of efficacy to juſtification, with the vertue of Chriſt glorifyed? It is to be acknowledged that the nothingneſſe of the one is of as full validity as the omnipotency (if I may ſo terme it) of the other to beget new love, new purpoſes, new acts in Gods will. This is that which God himſelf cannot do, not becauſe it is a work above his power, but beneath his nature and perfection, to work or to be capable of the working of any new impreſſions or changes in his will. Nevertheleſſe this excuſeth not Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> vilifying of Chriſt in mating his interceſſion with the ſinners ſupplication, as if the former were a ſtar of the ſame magnitude with the latter: like that profane fellow that twiſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion and Cheeſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="320" facs="tcp:167891:187"/>3 Not to trifle away time upon every trifling word of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I demand of him why (ſeeing in the Explication, <hi>pa.</hi> 215. he acknowledgeth that <hi>Procatarcticall or [outwardly] impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſes have properly no place with God</hi>] he doth yet in his <hi>Theſis</hi> here fetch about again his four impulſive cauſes to marke them with ſeverall names in their foreheads in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> print? is it not a teſtimony under his own hand that he will rather play and dance about God as if he were a meer may-pole, then loſe the oſtentation of one leaſt peece of his wit and art?</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Though I mean not to contend about the meritorious cauſality of Chriſts ſatisfaction, becauſe in this he hath as well many orthodox writers as Papiſts ſpeaking in the ſame tone with him: nevertheleſſe I ſhould deny his aſſertion unleſſe he he will grant me theſe 4. or 5. ſuppoſitions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That ſo far as juſtification is an act eternall and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in God, Chriſts ſatisfaction is not the meritorious cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If in ſome other reſpect it be the meritorious cauſe, that God doth therein merit from himſelf. For the ſatisfaction made to him is of his own proper money, himſelfe paid the price in delivering his Sonne for our ſinnes, the body which Chriſt offered for us was given him by the Father to offer in our behalf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this merit muſt in no wiſe hinder, but that the entire benefit of juſtification muſt come to us freely without money and without price.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That it is but unproperly termed merit even then when it reſpecteth the diſcharge which God giveth into a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it being ſo called metaphorically as our ſtate in ſin is conſidered as a ſtate of debt, which when Chriſt our ſurety hath paid for us he hath ſo far merited only, as the payment of our debt may be ſaid to deſerve that we ſhould receive a full acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the debt. In which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> goeth yet further, that it was ſo paid, that the Creditour might have choſen to accept it for ſatisfaction, much more to have given us a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance and diſcharge. So that in relation to him and his principles, it is leſſe properly merit, then to another.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That Chriſts ſatisfaction is more properly to be called Gods foundation of this our new relation of juſtifyed perſons,

                        <p>We have here as elſewhere a Momus among the Gods, a curious and carping Critick againſt not only Eccleſiaſticall but Canonicall writings alſo, no farther owning what they ſpeak then as they ſpeak it in a dialecticall dialect, ſo ſetting <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> above Chriſt and weighing all the ſentences of the Goſpell in the ſcales of Logicall terms and maxims, and <hi>Socinus</hi>-like ſubmitting all the truths of the Goſpell to reaſon, yea to the rules of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> logick or reaſon; <hi>Juſtification is an act ſaith he, and there is no matter of an act,</hi> ergo, <hi>it hath no materiall cauſe.</hi> Chriſt therefore and his Apoſtles, yea all the Doctors of the Church that ſpeak after the Scriptures, are dunces, delivering a vain Theologie not truely Theologicall, becauſe not after the Peripateticks precepts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Logicall.</p>
                        <p>But what law of Medes and Perſians can binde the holy Ghoſt never to mention juſtification but ſtrictly under the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an act?

The thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I acknowledge, (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> granting what he grants) is not of great moment; but the ſupercilious haughtineſſe of the man puft with the opinion of his ſecular learning ſo high as to puf and pif at ſo many excellent Divines for learning and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to many of which he is not worthy to be an <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> is unſufferable. I ſhall therefore as briefly as I can expreſſe upon what grounds our Divines and how far they make the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt the matter of our juſtification, as near as I may upon good probabilities conjecture.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrine of juſtification by Chriſt, is no where in the four Evangeliſts held forth under the name of juſtification or juſtifying. Many both Parables and clear doctrines that proceeded from the lips of Chriſt, do indeed in other words fully diſplay it; ſpecially <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, who made it more his task to record the doctrine then the acts of Chriſt (becauſe he ſaw thoſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorifyed ſomewhat largely by the other three Evangeliſts which had written before him,) Eagle-like mounting on high to the contemplation of his Celeſtiall and Divine nature and doctrines, very exactly ſets it forth but under other words, naming it <hi>Life, eternall Life, everlaſting Life; He that beleeveth in the Son hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, Joh. 3. 36. Is paſſed from death to life, Joh. 5. 24. Hath eternall life, Joh. 6. 54. My fleſh which I give for the life of the world, Joh. 6. 51. And ye will not come to me that ye may have life, Joh. 5. 40. Except ye eat my fleſh and drink my bloud, ye have no life in you, he that eateth me ſhall live by me, Joh.</hi> 6. 57. In all which and many other texts of this Evangeliſt none can deny but by life is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood chiefly, if not only, life in law, the life of juſtification, not that of glory which is to be received above, but that of grace here. For ſo thoſe Scriptures point out a life here in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world enduring everlaſtingly to all eternity, and not a life here only to be hoped for, and hereafter to come into our fruition. Neither do I find the word [juſtifie] uſed but once by <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> Nor yet at all in any one of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles (St. <hi>James</hi> only excepted in one Chapter) but by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alone. Yet the ſubſtance of juſtification was the chief doctrine in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all their Epiſtles handled, but the ſame ſet
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:167891:189"/> forth under the name of <hi>Salvation, ſaving, life,</hi> and other phraſes which our Saviour himſelf uſed. And theſe phraſes alſo doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſe as equipollent with the word Juſtifying in all his Epiſtles.</p>
                        <p>Now the reaſon why this Apoſtle more then the reſt treats of this doctrine under the name of [juſtification] I conceive to be this: Becauſe he was forced to handle it by way of controverſie againſt the falſe Apoſtles, ſome profeſſing, ſome rejecting Chriſt, that taught juſtification and ſalvation by the works of the Law in part, and not by faith only; whom therefore he muſt needs in his diſputes treat with in their own tearms and words. Their Argumentation againſt the Apoſtle (as may be gathered from the Apoſtles anſwers) ran in this tenour and to this effect, That righteouſneſſe alone which juſtifyeth or maketh a man perfectly righteous, ſaveth. But the righteouſneſſe of the Law, is that righteouſneſſe alone which juſtifyeth or maketh man perfectly righteous, at leaſt by procuring proper righteouſneſſe to him: therefore that alone ſaveth.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle here granteth the propoſition, that no other righteouſneſſe but that which juſtifyeth or maketh a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous ſaveth: But denyeth the aſſumption, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law only or at all juſtifyeth or maketh a man perfectly righteous: Becauſe only the perfect doers of the law are perfectly righteous, not the hearers. But no man can perfectly do it. And contrariwiſe proveth that the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel which he cals <hi>the Righteouſneſſe of God, the Righteouſneſſe of faith, the Righteouſneſſe of God by faith,</hi> which conſiſteth in Chriſts ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction imputed to us, is the Righteouſneſſe which juſtifyeth and maketh perfectly righteous, becauſe it cleanſeth from the guilt and freeth from the imputation of all ſin and unrighteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. &amp; 3. 5, 21, 22, 25, 26. &amp; 4. 3, 5, 6, 11. &amp; 5. 17, 18, 21. &amp; 9. 30. &amp; 10. 3, 4, 6. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Phil.</hi> 3. 9. In all which places and in many other the Apoſtle having rejected the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of works from being, aſſerteth the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt by faith, to be the righteouſneſſe, the matter and ſubſtance of the righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtifyed. This he illuſtrateth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. by a compariſon between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Christ, Adams</hi> diſobedience and <hi>Chriſts</hi> obedience, <hi>As by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of one man, many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made roghteous:</hi> the ones diſobedience was not only the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:167891:190"/> merit, but alſo the matter of our ſin, as far as ſin is capable of matter, the very ſin it ſelf, which being imputed to us as being in him, without any perſonall and actuall ſin of our own, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes us ſinners. So the obedience of Chriſt in offering himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, and giving ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that poſitive command of the Father which required it, was and is not only the merit, but alſo the matter of that righteouſneſſe which being imputed to us (as being in Chriſt) without any perſonall obedience of ours added to it, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth us righteous and juſtifyed in Gods acceptance, or is that for by and in which the Lord pronounceth us juſt and juſtifyed to our own conſciences. Such is the frequent diſpute of the Apoſtle about the ſubſtance and matter of that righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtify ad, which he concludes not to be a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inherent in us, but this <hi>Righteouſneſſe inherent in Chriſt, but imputed to us and apprehended by faith to juſtification; whom God hath ſet forth as a propitiation for our ſinnes through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And this is all that I finde our Divines to mean in ſaying the righteouſneſſe or ſatisfaction of Chriſt is the materiall cauſe of our juſtification defending againſt the Papiſts as the Apoſtle did againſts the Phariſees, that the matter of the righteouſneſſe which God accepteth and imputeth to us in juſtifying us, or unto righteouſneſſe and juſtification, is this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt only, not the righteouſneſſe of works. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the phraſe, 1. As rude and not Logicall; 2. As at the beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; doth firſt, accuſe the Apoſtle; and ſecondarily, them that follow his Apoſtolicall doctrine and phraſe, of this rudeneſſe and impropriety of language: One of them ſpeaks out the minde of the reſt, <hi>Deus juſtitiam, i. e.

                        <p>Here before I can underſtand the depths of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I muſt be reſolved by him in ſome Queries.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether juſtification hath its being before it hath its form? For the form doth more unexceptively give the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the name; and is in order of nature before the thing formed or named.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If not, Whether then there were ever a juſtifyed man (after the tenour of the new Covenant) upon earth, or ever ſhall be ſuch? For if the acquitting of the ſinner from the accuſation and condemnation of the Law, or the diſabling of the Law to accuſe or condemn, be the form of juſtification, then is juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unformed and without being (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) untill the day of Judgment. Untill then he binds all hand and foot under the threatnings and curſe of the Law; as we have ſeen in and under his 9, 11, 12, &amp; 13. <hi>Theſis,</hi> and how long after he doth not yet certifie us: ſo that if this be the form of juſtification, then after his principles there neither is nor ſhall be either juſtification or any juſtifyed perſon as long as the world laſteth, either in heaven or upon earth. Except Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will ſay the law is ſo dealt with by Chriſt, as <hi>Cnipperdoling</hi> was by <hi>John a Leyden,</hi> of the higheſt magiſtrate and judge made tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor or hangman, depoſed from being any longer a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:167891:191"/> Accuſer, Judge or Condemner of guilty perſons; and made an Executioner and Tormentor of them whom no Law accuſeth or condemneth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether the Law accuſeth or condemneth of any thing elſe but of ſin? And if not, Whether Gods acquitting the ſinner from the Lawes accuſation and condemnation, be not his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting the ſinner from all ſin that might expoſe him to the Lawes accuſing and condemning? This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt grant except he will ſay a man may be acquitted from the Lawes, yet left unto the Devils accuſation and condemnation, as he ſeems before to hint. But this is no other acquitting but from the frying-pan into the fire, from a juſt accuſer and Judge, into the tyranny of an unjuſt ſlanderer and deſtroyer. Such a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication with its form we decline as damnation it ſelfe: if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can with his Sophiſtry charm the Devill, let him grapple with him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whether the imputation of righteouſneſſe and the not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſin be not the ſame thing, neither an act diſtinct from the other, but each connoting and implying the other? For ſo he anſwers the queſtion, denying imputation to be the form, <hi>viz.</hi> imputation of righteouſneſſe, without the adject terme of diminution, the righteouſneſſe [<hi>of Chriſt</hi>] knowing well that ſome of the moſt conſiderate of the Antipapiſticall Divines place the form of juſtification, in the imputation of righteouſneſs, not in the imputation of Chriſts <hi>righteouſneſſe (viz.</hi> which he hath done) Theſe two Quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="5">5. Whether then there be any difference between Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> form of juſtification, and that form which he impugneth? Whether the acquitting of the ſinner from the Law, from ſin which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to the Lawes accuſation and condemnation, be not the ſame thing in ſubſtance with Gods imputing of righteouſneſſe, and not imputing of ſin to him? What hath the one of theſe (ſave words alone) more or leſſe in it then the other? They muſt be Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Lynces eyes that are buſied in the ſpeculation of <hi>Democritus</hi> his <hi>Atomes</hi> and <hi>Platoes Ideas,</hi> that can diſcern the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, my blunt fancie is uncapable and uncomprehenſive of it.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi>I believe</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter) that this imputing doth in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goe before juſtifying.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:167891:191"/>
                        <p>And doth not the form in order of nature go before the thing formed? how elſe doth the form give it its <hi>ultimum eſſe?</hi> This more proves then denies imputation to be the form.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> And that the righteouſneſſe ſo imputed is the proper ground whence we are denominated legally righteous, and why the Law cannot condemn us.</q>
                        <p>This alſo makes more for us, then for him. He tels us before that the forme gives the name. Now to be Legally righteous in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> phraſe, is to be righteous in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction. He that is ſo, is juſtifyed in title of Law, (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> termes it, and here treats of it) if then it give deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of legally righteous, it gives the name of juſtification in title of Law; (except he will ſay that a man is legally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Chriſt before Gods gracious act makes him ſuch) if ſo, then is imputation the form of juſtification becauſe it gives it its name. He concludes well;</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> It is a vain thing to quarrell about the Logicall names of the cauſes of juſtification, if we agree in the matter.</q>
                        <p>Yet ſee I no other ground that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath to take up this quarrell againſt the whole ſtream of Proteſtant Divines in refuſing and oppugning the form of juſtification which they give, but to quarrell about names and words. The form which he ſubſtituteth in place of theirs, being the ſame with theirs in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and differing only in Logicall not Theologicall names and words. Unleſſe ſome will ſay there is a reall as well as a nominall difference between the diſabling of the Law to accuſe of ſin, and Gods not imputing ſin; <hi>i. e.</hi> between the Lawes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting, and Gods acquitting from ſin; between the Lawes not imputing unrighteouſneſſe, and Gods imputing righteouſneſſe; which is all one as if I ſhould put a difference between the pardon that diſables the Law of the Land from accuſing and condemning of a malefactor, and a pardon which acquits him from the offence which the ſame Law had power to accuſe him of, or between the not accuſing or condemning of a man, and the not imputing any thing to him to his accuſation and condemnation.</p>

It is not the deſire of them that are of his hair to trudge ſingle, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a whole Brigade of diſciple under their conducting and ſeducing unto <hi>Rome.</hi> But let us come to his Arguments.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> If faith be an inſtrument, it is the inſtrument of God or Man. But of neither of theſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> not at all an inſtrument.</q>
                        <p>His Propoſition or Major we grant him. And it were enough and full to that which can be expected to refell his reaſons which he brings for the proof of the minor. Yet becauſe my drift is not ſo much to anſwer him, as to ſtabliſh ſome weak and unwary Chriſtians againſt his impoſtures, I ſhall endeavour firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what he denyeth and ſeeks to ſhiver, and then to examine the ſtrength of reaſon which he brings againſt us.</p>
                        <p>When he ſaith in the Minor, that faith is the inſtrument neither of God nor Man in juſtification; What if I ſhould undertake to prove and defend it to be the inſtrument of both? He ſpeaketh here of Juſtification as taken Paſſively, declared to, and termined upon the conſcience. For if we ſhould mention juſtification as taken meerly Actively, for that internall, eternall and immanent act in God; not tranſient upon an extraneous ſubject, but hid in God before the world was, or any juſtifyed or unjuſtifyed perſons began to live or be: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would be ready to deal with us as did the <hi>Jewes</hi> with <hi>Steven, Act.</hi> 7. 57. ſtop his ears and cry out againſt us with a loud voice, Blaſphemy, blaſphemy. Yet in this ſenſe we acknowledge that ſaith is neither Gods nor Mans inſtument of juſtification. But in that ſenſe which alone Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here taketh juſtification for that gracious act of God by which he diſchargeth for Chriſts ſake the ſinner from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by vertue of the new Covenant, and that pretious Goſpell promiſe, <hi>He that beleeveth in the Son ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life:</hi> ſo I affirm faith to be both Gods and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:167891:193"/> Mans inſtrument, Gods effective and mans receptive inſtrument in relation to juſtification, as ſhall be beneath more fully explained.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, it is Gods inſtrument. This juſtification is but Gods pronouncing and declaring a man to his own conſcience to be juſt and diſcharged from ſin and condemnation through Chriſt, ſo that he perceives and apprehends himſelf abſolved and doth acquieſce in this abſolution. One chief inſtrument by which God doth thus juſtifie or declare and manifeſt man to himſelf juſt and pardoned, is faith. This is Gods inſtrument in the ſame ſenſe in which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> maketh the promiſe and grant of the new Covenant to be Gods inſtrument, and that more fully (as I in part ſhewed before.) For that grant doth but declare a poſſibility to a man (as it is conſidered by it ſelf) to be juſtifyed; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forgiveneſſe and life to all that ſhall beleeve. By this act alone no ſingular perſon is actually juſtifyed. But now this grant premiſed, when God is pleaſed to infuſe faith into the ſoul of any ſingular perſon, by it as by his inſtrument he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that perſon to himſelf juſt and acquitted from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that he can thenceforth plead out his own juſtification. God hath pronounced them all juſt and pardoned which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in his Son: I ſo beleeve, therefore I am pronounced and declared of God juſt and pardoned. So this faith is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, (for ſo Lawyers term Deeds and Grants in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>inſtruments,</hi> yea inſtruments of him that makes the Deed or Grant.) And the promiſe of the new Covenant or the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>novum Inſtrumentum;</hi> as it is his evidence written (not without the man as that Goſpell grant) but by the finger of Gods Spirit in the hearts of the Elect, ſo that they may read this inſtrument of Gods writing within their hearts evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing and manifeſting to themſelves their juſtification from God. And this is one principall inſtrument and evidence of God promiſed under the new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31-35. recited (as now fulfilled) by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8-12. &amp; 10. 16, 17. <hi>I will write my Lawes in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. what Law but the rule, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and evidence of life and ſalva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yes this, <hi>They ſhall not need</hi> [externall] <hi>teaching to know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> What knowledg of God was this whereupon they ſhould not need teachers? They ſhall <hi>know him to be their God, their Juſtifyer,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:167891:194"/> their Saviour,</hi> for ſo much intimate the next words, <hi>For I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their iniquities, and remember their ſins no more.</hi> This was one chief part of the Law, or will of God written in their hearts, juſtification or everlaſting remiſſion of ſins. This they ſhould not need to be taught from without, the inſtrument of writing or evidence thereof ſhould be within their own hearts apparent, not to others but their own reading. And what more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall evidence or inſtrument of writing within our hearts thus to aſſure us, then our faith, engraven by Gods own hand in us? I appeal to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf whether I wreſt this Scripture from its proper ſenſe; or if any ſhall except againſt me, I doubt not but I ſhall make it good to be the minde of the holy Ghoſt, which I have here given. To the ſame purpoſe is it, that <hi>Faith is called the Evidence of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Whoſe evidence? Gods evidence given us, by which he declareth to us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth to our conſciences the inviſible things of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſalvation: and when given, then our evidence alſo by which we not only apprehend, but alſo plead againſt all the accuſations of the Law, yea of ſin and Satan, our actuall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And that it is called <hi>the witneſſe of God in us;</hi> or, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; becauſe God by this witneſſe as his inſtrument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares and evidenceth us to our own conſciences juſtifyed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is mans inſtrument by which he applyeth to himſelf, and without which he cannot applie to himſelf this juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and remiſſion of the new Covenant to know and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, that he may reſt and rejoyce in it, being juſtifyed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his own knowledge and conſcience; <hi>God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing to them their treſpaſſes, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Reconciliation and Juſtification (as hath been ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That we may receive it therefore from him in Chriſt, he gives us (as many as are his Elect) this living faith as an inſtrument by which he may apply it and bring it home into our boſomes.

Yea given to us to be the ſole inſtrument on our part by which to apply to our ſelves the juſtification offered by God in Chriſt, Or what elſe is meant by the generall voice of the Goſpell pronouncing us to be juſtifyed by faith, but by faith Gods inſtrument and evidence to declare and manifeſt it to our ſouls, and our inſtrument to apprehend and hold it faſt and firm to our ſelves? It remaineth now to examin Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> reaſons by which he aſſayeth to prove that it is neither mans nor Gods inſtrument.</p>

Yet what ever it be (though not the leaſt portion of Gods word in it) let us examine the ſtrength of it It is the principall efficient, of the act or effect, that worketh by the inſtrument, ſaith he; but man is not the principall efficient, therefore worketh not in this buſineſſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or inſtrumentall helps.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer 1. (not only in reſevence to this, but to that which alſo followeth in his Argumentation) We are to diſtinguiſh between inſtruments, that they are of two kinds, effective or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive. Effective, ſo is a knife the inſtrument of cutting: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, ſo is the hand the inſtrument of receiving. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments are applyed to the former only, not at all to the latter. For</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="336" facs="tcp:167891:195"/>1. Of an Effective inſtument it may be ſaid, the knife cuts and the Man cuts likewiſe: But a Receptive inſtrument hath a double relation; 1. To the giver; 2. To the receiver. As if a rich man give a great treaſure to a poor man, he receiveth it in his hand: the receptive inſtrument of the poor mans inriching is his hand. Now if a man ſhould argue as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth; the hand if it be an inſtrument it is an inſtrument either of the giver or receiver; not of the receiver, for he doth not inrich himſelf, he is not the principall agent inriching: not of the giver, for he doth not receive any riches, but the act of the hand is to receive; therefore the inſtrument of neither, nor at all an inſtrument: Who ſees not the vanity of ſuch an Argument? Yet ſuch is this paralogiſm of Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> I ſay therefore that the Canons of an inſtrument which he citeth out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Schibler,</hi> hold only of effective, not of receptive inſtruments. Yet as faith is Gods effective inſtrument to juſtifie man, and not himſelf, (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> trifleth) ſo theſe Canons hold of it alſo in the ſenſe before ſpecifyed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I deny the Aſſumption or Minor; he proves it thus, <hi>Man doth not juſtifie himſelf.</hi> This is an equivocation, and beſides the queſtion. None ever made man the <hi>cauſa prima</hi> of his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none I mean of all thoſe whom Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> diſputes againſt. Himſelf indeed and his followers aſſerting the perfection and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of mans righteouſneſſe conſiſting in faith and good works, and affirming that this righteouſneſſe of man, and in man, doth give him title to the righteouſneſſe which is by Chriſt, cannot well be cleared from making man the firſt tauſe of his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

O that there had been but a moytie of the reverence and conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, to annihilate man, and advance the glory of Gods grace, in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> which aboundeth in many of thoſe whom he here oppoſeth; he then ſurely would have caſt this pernicious pamphlet of his into hell-fire, (if it had been poſſible) rather then publiſhed it to the nulling of Gods, and deifying of mans righteouſneſſe. But to the matter, we dare and that in the fear and preſence of God to aver,</p>
                        <p>1. That the declaration of a man to his own conſcience and evidencing to his ſoul that he is juſtifyed in Chriſt, to be the one and ſame action of God the principall cauſe and of faith the inſtrument. The declaration and manifeſtation of juſtification to the ſoul is here the action, God as the principall cauſe doth it by faith his evidence and inſtrument; faith as the inſtrument and evidence doth it from God as the principall cauſe, in manner before expreſſed. God healed <hi>Naaman</hi> of his Leproſie by the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> as his inſtrument; did many wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Sea, and in the wilderneſſe by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod as his inſtrument; ſubverted the wals and Towers
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:167891:197"/> of <hi>Jericho</hi> by the inſtrumentall ſubſerviency of mens voices and the ſound or winde of Rams horns and Trumpets: Chriſt gave ſight to the blind man by a plaiſter of clay applyed to his eyes. Will he not acknowledg all theſe wonders to be the actions both of God the principall cauſe, and of theſe ſo feeble inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo? The deſpicableneſſe of the inſtruments and means do not ſpoyl God of, but viſibly attribute unto God the whole glory of his grace and power which in the uſe of more noble inſtruments would not appear ſo ſenſibly unto ſome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; much more is the ſame action the action both of God and faith his inſtrument, and this without all ſeeming ground of contradiction, when we attribute not to faith any inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality under God to the working or effecting, but only to the declaring and evidencing to man his juſtification, before effected and compleated in God and in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And 2. That faith as Gods inſtrument hath influx (in its kinde) to produce this effect [the evidencing of mans juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf] by a proper cauſality. I mean not, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> I thinke means not by a cauſality that is naturally its own and proper to it: but by a proper cauſality which God hath given it in appointing and uſing it as his inſtrument to produce the effect. Will deny any this to be true of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned inſtruments? He that made them his inſtruments begat in them a cauſality, and power inſtrumentally by and under him to produce thoſe effects.</p>
                        <p>Indeed to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in reſpect of his principles, that denies Juſtification as an immanent act in God conſtituting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting us righteous, and will have this to be done only by a temporaneous and tranſient act of God by the grace of the new Covenant, theſe aſſertions muſt ſeem to have ſome monſtroſity upon their faces, that faith ſhould be ſo the inſtrument of God in juſtifying or making us juſt. Yet ſuch as he can eaſily ſwallow, becauſe on the other ſide his juſtification is but an univerſall conditionall juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi> a juſtification in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, or impoſſibility, but not at all in being; and that faith ſhould be termed the conditionall inſtrument of God in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a conditionall juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſee not why it ſhould ſet the man in a chafe, he puts the <hi>dare</hi> to it therefore (I ſuppoſe) to make it too hot for the ſwallowing of weak and fearfull Chriſtians. To them that know whoſoever are juſtifyed in themſelves, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:167891:197"/> is, declared to be ſuch within their own conſciences, the ſame were juſtifyed in God in Chriſt from all eternity: ſo that fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The objection which he addes, by which he pretends we ſeek to evade, we own not, neither have we need in the defence of truth to ſeek evaſions. Let him name ſome one of his [ſome] that have ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a paſſive inſtrument of juſtification, or elſe leave us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the objection is of his own head; partly to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby, yet further to take his paſtime in his Logicall and Metaphyſicall learning, which may poſſibly pleaſe him but never juſtifie or ſave him; and partly by ſhewing the weakneſſe of the objection to gull his unwary reader with an opinion of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their cauſe, who are forced with ſuch <hi>Egyptian</hi> reeds (for lack of better pillars) to ſuſtain it. It is one of the Jeſuits principles to fetch armes indifferently either from heaven or hell to ſtorm the Church and truth of Chriſt, and to promote the holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harlot of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I am weary following him while he brings nothing but the <hi>Socinians</hi> right reaſon to be judge of the Myſterious doctrines of Chriſt; and fear whether it be anſwerable before God, to ſpend time in anſwering his babble with babble again; for the truth of Chriſt doth neither ſtand nor fall by what can be ſaid for it or againſt it out of the principles or learning of abuſed <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> call to minde what he hath read as elſewhere, ſo in his adored <hi>Schibler</hi> in the ſecond book of his <hi>Metaph.

It argues that he undertakes a buſineſſe not for God, but againſt him, elſe would he not caſt away ſpirituall and take up fleſhly arms to maintain it. But fith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> we ſhall crave leave to ſpeak the leſſe to him henceforth where we find him
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:167891:198"/> to have little of the word, and reſerve our ſelves to ſpeak more largely where the man for his recreation vouchſafeth to abaſe himſelf ſo low as to meddle with Scriptures.</p>

                        <p>I have before expreſſed in what ſenſe we make or at leaſt hold faith to be mans inſtrument in applying Juſtification to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And 2. have manifeſted the teſtimonies and authority of the Scripture herein; ſo that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> if he liſt (as it liſteth him) to cavill, cavils not ſo much againſt all godly Proteſtant writers whom he oppoſeth, as againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking by the mouth of Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, whom thorow the loins of thoſe he ſmites at. It is not the firſt time that he hath accuſed Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt in this manner of impropriety and unfitneſſe of expreſſions in Scriptures. And why? becauſe they ſpeak not enough logically, and in all probability never read thorow <hi>Ariſtotles Metaphyſicks.</hi> But let us hear what he can ſay
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:167891:198"/> here to prove the unproperneſſe of that language which calleth faith an inſtrument of receiving Chriſt and juſtification in and by him. His reaſons are above in his own words ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                        <p>To the firſt I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes and layes his own principles of Religion, and from them, as from an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mount he battereth Chriſt and his doctrine. Should we grant him that faith is the receiving of Chriſt, yet</p>
                        <p n="1">1. How ſhall it appear otherwiſe then by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own Magiſteriall dictates, that juſtifying faith is nothing elſe but the receiving of Chriſt?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Why elſe doth he make it ſimply and only a quality or act of the ſoul without the adjection of its originall from above, but to ingenerate into the minds of men an opinion that it hath its emanancy and riſe from nature, from freewill, that every man may have and act it, if, and when he will; and that it is not infuſed of God to be inſtrumentall by his appointment for the producing of any ſpirituall effect?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How doth he prove that onely the act of faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth? Yet</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If all theſe dubious things were granted to him, his own words therein tend to the confirmation rather then the infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the main concluſion which he oppoſeth that faith is the inſtrument of juſtification. For if the act of faith be the receiving, then muſt faith it ſelf ſo acting be the receptrix, or that by which we receive Chriſt: but that by which man receiveth Chriſt is inſtrumentall to his receiving of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for Chriſt is made of God to us righteouſneſſe, he that hath Chriſt hath life; ſpecially this will follow upon Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> principle of Chriſt and juſtification given to all univerſally, to none in particular; he muſt be made ours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by receiving him; and if faith doth receive, how doth it receive but as an inſtrument? or whereas the well is deep, and we have nothing of our own to draw with, what ſhall be the inſtrument of drawing and receiving if faith be not it?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And in this lyeth Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Sophiſm, that he puts the act of faith for faith actuated. Though the act of faith were the receiving of Chriſt, yet faith actuated and acting is that by which we receive Chriſt, and to ſay that by which we receive is the inſtrument of our receiving
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:167891:199"/> is not a hard but a proper ſaying. The act of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> hand was the writing of theſe lines. To ſay that his writing was the inſtrument of his writing is a hard ſaying; but to ſay his hand acted in writing was his inſtrument of writing it is not a hard ſaying.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond. It is wholly Sophiſticall. For when he ſaith,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſanctifyed faculty it ſelf cannot be the ſouls inſtrument, becauſe it is the ſoul it ſelf: what is this to the purpoſe? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts he the ſoul for the man, but to cheat in ſtead of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his reader? If any ſay faith is the inſtrument of the ſoul, he ſpeaks by a Synecdoche, putting the part, the chief eſſentiall part of man for the whole man, after the common uſe of the Scriptures; and why may not the ſeverall faculties of the ſoul be as well mans inſtruments as the ſeverall members of the body? It is not unproper to call the eye the inſtrument by which man ſeeth; or his ear the inſtrument of hearing; or the the tongue of ſpeaking; or the hand of working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why ſhould it be then unproper to call the faculties of the ſoul the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of man to act thoſe offices by each faculty to which each faculty is appropriated? Or when faith is infuſed into the ſoul, doth it diſinſtrument the faculties thereof, that they become no more inſtrumentall to man in their places? Nay it makes them inſtrumentall to work henceforth upon ſpirituall, as before upon naturall and morall objects. And this alſo anſwereth his ſecond reaſon why the habit of faith cannot fitly be called our inſtrument; becauſe (ſaith he) the holineſſe of the faculties is not their inſtrument. I grant it, but this is not the queſtion. That which he was to diſprove is, that faith makes not the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul into which it is infuſed, inſtrumentall to the applying of Chriſt to juſtification. The Compaſſe is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners inſtrument by which to ſteer his ſhip, yet would it be nothing inſtrumentall to this purpoſe were it not touched with the Loadſtone that points it to the North-pole; ſo are the will and underſtanding inſtrumentall to the receiving of Chriſt and juſtification in and by him: not by any innate power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they are touched and pointed directly by faith, to the bloud of Chriſt for juſtification; as to the doctrine of Chriſt for illumination, and to the Spirit of Chriſt for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And for this cauſe we call not ſo much the faculty of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:167891:199"/> the ſoul the inſtrument, as faith, becauſe faith makes it inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to juſtification. The power and diſpoſition which it hath to this act being not naturall from it ſelf, but ſupernaturall from faith infuſed into it, and working on it. In ſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering in order to every particle of what he addeth, it ſhall ſuffice to diſcover his Sophiſtry by which he ſeeketh to elude a ſacred truth of the Goſpell, in all that he ſaith upon this Argument, and this will be enough in anſwer to all that he ſaith, yea manifeſt him <hi>unworthy of an anſwer.</hi> As before he firſt maketh all the inſtrumentality or cauſality (whether proper or improper) of faith to conſiſt in the act of faith, or faith actuated; as if the Chirurgeons inſtruments were not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments while they lie by him, but then only while he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſeth them in the ſeverall offices to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and faith were no longer an inſtrument (if an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) of juſtification, then while it is actually receiving Chriſt, and ſo the ſame man ſhould be juſtifyed and unjuſtifyed oft in the ſame day, in the ſame hour, being no longer juſtifyed then while faith is in the act of applying Chriſt. And</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In contracting the whole man, yea Chriſtian into a ſoul as if we did make ſuch a faculty of the ſoul the ſouls and not the mans inſtrument to receive Chriſt, which himſelf knoweth to be the meaning of no one of them againſt whom he fighteth, but a ſlanderous and ſubtle trick of his own deviſing to make their doctrine ſeem abſurd in an alien ſenſe, which in their own ſenſe he can in no wiſe confute. So</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Here he further ſophiſticateth and perverteth their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in contracting the whole man (not only into a ſoul, which he had done before, but) into ſome one or two facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul into which faith is infuſed and inherent as in its ſubject, as if they taught that faith is the inſtrument of a faculty, and not mans inſtrument. The holineſſe of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is not their, <hi>i. e.</hi> the faculties inſtrument (ſaith he) but themſelves rectifyed. The abſurdities therefore which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as conſequents of ſuch an aſſertion are the conſequents of his ſlander, not of their doctrine. None ever taught faith to be the inſtrument of a faculty, or inſtrumentall to juſtifie a facultie, but mans inſtrument and nſtrumentall to juſtifie man.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="346" facs="tcp:167891:200"/>4. In ſuppoſing it as a thing granted that faith in the ſoul or faculties of the ſoul is nothing but the holineſſe of ſuch faculties, or their being rectifyed, and not a being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſo diſtinct as may be called their inſtrument; a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine well agreeing with his principles who makes ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the condition of juſtification, and no further attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes any thing to faith but as it is a part of our ſanctification, <hi>Pag. 195. n.</hi> 5, 6. and thorowout this whole Treatiſe: but altogether denied by the Proteſtant Churches, which aſcribe not to faith any inſtrrumentality to juſtification, as it is a part of our holineſſe and rectitude; but as by a ſupernaturall virtue which it infuſeth into the ſoul to carry it out to Chriſt, to God in Chriſt for remiſſion and reconciliation. Otherwiſe godlineſſe, hope, love, meekneſſe, and all other the fruits of the Spirit, ſhould juſtifie us equally with faith, becauſe the holineſſe and rectitude of the ſoul conſiſteth no leſſe in theſe then in faith. And this is the thing in queſtion, if we grant it all is granted which the worſt of Jeſuites ſeeks, or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this whole book contends for; ſo that to make the whole thing in queſtion, a known and granted concluſion from which he will prove a particle in queſtion, is too groſſe and un-<hi>Baxterlike</hi> a Sophiſm; he is wont to ſpin finer webs, what make ſuch courſe threads in his fingers? And why ſaith he, <hi>Not ſo diſtinct?</hi> is faith a being diſtinct from the faculty in which it is? Even this that it is a being diſtinct from the eſſence of man, ſpeaks it capable of an inſtrumentality to mans juſtification, eſpecially God having appointed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to that end; much more of being an inſtrument in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for mans uſe, which is all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould have denyed, when he denies it to be the faculties inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In reiterating the ſoul for the whole man, and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing captious words to it, <hi>Who ever called habits or diſpoſitions the ſouls inſtruments?</hi> Thus he playes the Sophiſter to make the inſtrumentality of faith ridiculous, as if we affirmed it inſtrumentall to juſtification <hi>quatenus</hi> as it is, and only in this reſpect becauſe it is a habit or diſpoſition of the ſoul; when contrariwiſe we aſcribe this power and office to it, as it is a virtue or gift of grace, endewed with this property from
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:167891:200"/> the author of it to cleave to Chriſt, and draw forth the ſoul with it to Chriſt for juſtification, as hath been before expreſſed; and in this office it hath no other habit, power, or diſpoſition of the ſoul naturall or infuſed, a corrivall with it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. He at laſt deals no leſſe ſophiſtically in his compariſons; <hi>You may as well call</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a mans life his inſtrument of acting, or the ſharpneſſe of a knife the knives inſtrument, as to call our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or habituall faith the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of a cauſe to produce its effect, cannot be called the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no parity in the Compariſon: Life to acting, and faith to receiving of Chriſt are not (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not ſay they are) in one and the ſame kinde and order of cauſes and effects. Beſides, one of the effects is put with the other ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left without an object, as if the receiving of Chriſt were no more then, and altogether as naturall to man, as receiving indefinitely any naturall object; ſo that albeit this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon may ſtand in ſome parity with a naturall and civill faith without the object Chriſt annexed to it, yet the divine faith, whereof we hear ſpeak, is of an another, an upper and higher region, and agrees not in motion with the naturall life, or with the naturall or civill faith. The one moves its courſe and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a way that God by nature hath preſcribed, and the other in the way which God by grace hath prefixed. Their orbs are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not confounded either with other. As for the other Compariſon, the ſharpneſſe of the knife: Nothing elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly but the ſharpneſſe of M. <hi>Baxters</hi> wit could have deviſed it. Is then faith in man no more then ſharpneſſe in a knife? What good then might a ſhip-load of whet-ſtones and grinding-ſtones do among the <hi>Turks</hi> to make them Chriſtians? The ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the knife is not any thing really diſtinct from the knife; it is otherwiſe with the faith of a man. The knife is mans inſtrument, the ſharpneſſe thereof is but the aptitude of the inſtrument by which man as the efficient produceth the effect. How ſhall this ſquare in the <hi>Comparatum?</hi> Man muſt be the principall efficient cauſe, what will he aſſigne to be the inſtrument whereof faith is the aptitude to produce the effect?</p>

                        <p>Short and in compaſſe of words little is it which he here ſpeaketh, yet if we look to the matter thereof in it two things are principally to be examined.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he makes faith the condition of juſtification, and what he means by that term?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he cals it the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> He means (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) the ſame thing by both, but the words differ, and he uſeth both, as by both together, ſo by either part to get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his cauſe. Therefore I ſhall examine them ſeverally.</p>
                        <p>To the former I have ſpoke ſomewhat largely before in the examination of his 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 43, 44, &amp; 45. <hi>Theſes,</hi> as he gave me occaſion in theſe ſeverall poſitions to anſwer what he there aſſerted of conditionall juſtification. I have therefore here the leſſe to ſpeak, referring the reader to what hath been ſpoken before. Yea in this point I ſhould be totally ſilent, becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in words ſpeaks no more here then what ſome of our moſt ſound and godly Divines have ſpoken before him (that faith is the condition of juſtification) were it that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meaneth as they mean. For though in the beſt meaning of the beſt men the propriety of the terms or phraſe may be much queſtioned and give occaſion of much diſpute, yet traverſing controverſies about words, when there is agreement in the ſubſtance to which both parties drive, is in my apprehenſion a buſineſſe ſo far tending to diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and breach of union among the Saints, that it is the laſt and leaſt Trade (I am confident) that ever will befall me to drive. But in this point though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here ſpeaks in words what ſome of ours have ſaid, and do ſay ſtill, and that without
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:167891:202"/> any detriment (that I can ſee) to the Goſpell: Yet his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and theirs are in no leſſe antipathie then a Hawk and a Heron, and that as in other leſſer, ſo principally in theſe particulars of moment.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By faith they mena our application, or faith as it is our inſtrument of applying Chriſt and the grace of God in Chriſt to our juſtification; he by faith means not only the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>credere</hi> as a part of our inherent righteouſneſſe, but as a generall and common word that compriſeth within it ſelf all good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and good works whatſoever, as elſewhere, and ſpecially in and under his 70, &amp; 71. <hi>Theſes</hi> he declareth himſelfe; ſo that he makes and under the word Faith underſtandeth all theſe as equall conditions with faith of our juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By condition they mean that which being once attained and once fixed upon Chriſt, ſpeaks us abſolutely juſtifyed for ever. So that in calling faith the condition of juſtification, they mean we cannot be juſtifyed without it, but having once by faith apprehended Chriſt we are by it united and joyned to Chriſt, and by force of our union with him are thenceforth abſolutely and irrevocably pardoned and accepted as righteous in Gods fight. He cals it ſo a condition as that it continues ſtill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, juſtifying us only conditionally and not abſolutely, ſo that it leaves our eſtate ſtill one and the ſame, no more juſtifyed and pardoned when beleevers then when unbeleevers: For by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt we are before faith cometh conditionally juſtifyed if we beleeve, and when faith is come we remain ſtill but conditionally juſtifyed if we beleeve, our ſafety being as looſe and uncertain then as before, depending ſtill upon the reſidence and abode of faith in us as before it did upon the poſſibility of its future ingeneration into us and acting in us; and that we are no longer juſtifyed then while we beleeve and obey: ſo that by beleeving and unbeleeving, obeying and rebelling we may be juſtifyed and unjuſtifyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a thouſand times before we die, and how often after, himſelf expreſſes not. I need not mention more, theſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are enough to declare that although here he ſpeak in the ſame tone with ſome of our Divines, yet his judgement no more agrees with theirs then the <hi>Pope</hi> with <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvine, Elymas</hi> with <hi>Paul, Simon Magu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In ſtead of ſpeaking what might be further expected, I ſhall onely content my ſelf here to lay open ſome of the many monſtrous abſurdities and miſchiefs that follow this doctrine.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It proclaims mutability in God, and alteration in his minde and will, as ſwift and ſudden as in mutable and ſinfull man. For if God juſtifie and unjuſtifie, forgive and unforgive, love and hate, as oft as belief and unbelief, obedience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience do nod and ſucceed either after other in man through infirmity, then is there no more ſtedfaſtneſſe and conſiſtency with himſelf, in God then in man: but rather God is ſwayed hither and thither in willing and nilling, love and hatred by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux from man (as the Sea by the influx of the Moon) then man by influx from God. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſees this abſurdity, as well as his fellows the Arminians, and goes about here and there, by the Arminians <hi>Sophiſms</hi> (for lack of better) to wipe off the ſtain: telling us that the change is in man the object, and not in God. God hates <hi>Paul</hi> unbeleeving and perſecuting, but loves him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and obeying, the change is here in the object, not in God, <hi>No more then the Sun is changed by the variety of the Creatures, which it enlightneth and warmeth; or the glaſſe by the variety of faces, which it repreſents; or the eye by the variety of colours, which it beholdeth, pag.</hi> 174. But <hi>Aethiopem dealbat.</hi> If God love to ſalvation, and hate to damnation one and the ſame perſon, and love ſucceeds into the place of hatred, and hatred into the place of love, and God that erewhile willed the ſalvation, anon willeth the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and after that again the ſalvation of the ſame man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as this kinde of Anti-Goſpellers aſſert) this is one and the ſame mutableneſſe in God, whether it proceed from a principle of inconſtancy within, or from the mutation of the object with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. It denies not the Chameleons that change their colour from white to black, and black to white, to be mutable, becauſe theſe changes befall them from outward objects the divers colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Carpets on which they are laid. Or if he ſhall object (as do the Arminians) <hi>Here is no ſhew of change in God,</hi> for God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not his purpoſe of ſaving, becauſe he had never but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall purpoſe and will to ſave, <hi>viz.</hi> if man will beleeve and obey; and this conditionall intent remains in God ſtill, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a conditionall intent to hate and damn him if he perform not the conditions. I ſhould anſwer him in the words
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:167891:203"/> of our Divines in anſwer to the Arminians; and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows them to be beaten with ſhame out of this plea, therefore to decline the ſtrokes, I finde him not yet adventuring to make uſe of this obiection.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It denies (in effect and ſubſtance) the juſtification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any man in this life, for to forgive upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as no man hath power in himſelf to perform, is but a verball; not a reall forgiveneſſe. And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not let out one <hi>gry</hi> or <hi>iote</hi> from his lips that ſhall give hope to the ſinner, yea to the believer of any dram of grace and power, that the Lord will miniſter to the Elect more then to the reprobates for the ſupportation of their Faith: and from themſelves they have all propenſiveneſſe to fall, and no ſtrength to ſtand. In this reſpect therefore he makes the ſtate of beleevers worſe then the ſtate of unbeleevers. For <hi>Miſerrimum eſt fuiſſe beatos,</hi> To have had Faith, yea Chriſt in hand, and Heaven in hope, and then to fall from all, makes their caſe more miſerable, in the loſſe of it, then it would have been if they had never had any thing in hand or in hope.</p>
                        <p>It utterly deſtroyeth all joy in beleeving, all peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, all conſolation in the holy Ghoſt, while it ſets the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the arms of Chriſts love, and participation of his merits and benefits, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> placed <hi>Damocles</hi> at his table with all ſumptuous proviſions before him, Muſick, attendance, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe was Majeſtical or delightful to cheer him; but with a ſharp ſword hanging by a ſingle hair over his head threatning him. No other (after Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) is the ſtate of a beleever, in all his moſt ſpiritual enlargements and comforts in Chriſt, there is but a ſingle hair between him and hell fire. Death is in the pot of all his contentments. Fear of imminent vengeance gives him not leave to taſte one of the ſweet morſels upon, or crums that fall from Gods table. And this is a Goſpel from hell, contrary to the everlaſting Goſpel which Chriſt brought from heaven, giving a <hi>joy that none ſhall take from beleevers, Joh</hi> 16. 22. The foundation thereof, the love of God in Chriſt, remaining immutable, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, Rom</hi> 8. 38, 39.</p>
                        <p>4. Whereas there are three acts conſiderable about our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:167891:203"/> 1. Chriſts giving; 2. Gods accepting the ſatisfaction given for us; and 3. Gods juſtifying or declaring, and evidencing us juſtified in and to our conſciences, for this ſatisfaction ſo given and accepted; I would here demand of which of theſe Faith is a Condition. If he ſay of Chriſts giving ſatisfaction, this is a contradiction; for Chriſt gave ſatisfaction before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or lived; ſo that Faith which came after could not be the Condition of an Act that went before, except he will ſay that Chriſt muſt ſo oft dye as ſinners attain to beleeve: If of Gods acceptance, then more is aſcribed to our faith then to Chriſts death for our juſtification, and faith ſhall be more then collateral with the ſacrifice of Chriſt to our ſalvation, the ſufficiency of ſatisfaction remaining only in Chriſts bloud, but the efficacy thereof ariſing from mans faith: yea and ſo Chriſt ſhould have paid our debts, and ſpilt his bloud for us at the feet of the Father without knowing whether he would accept it or no, and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhould be the leaſt fruit of his death (for the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beleevers before his death is but conditionall untill the day of Judgement after Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and what may fall out as touching the apoſtaſie of their ſouls before that day is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.) And it being not known of thoſe that ſhould come after him, who or whether any would beleeve and perſevere in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. If of Gods juſtifying us in our ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> declaring and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing us juſtified, we do in ſome caſes acknowledge that God hides his face and evidenceth not his love in Chriſt in the ſame degree to all beleevers, but in God and in Chriſt they are ſtill juſtified, and their ſalvation is ſure. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhakes off this Act of Juſtification in diſdain, therefore the abſurdities which follow in his conditions in reſpect of one of the former cannot be avoided. I forbear to enlarge my ſelf further in this kinde here having ſpoken to it before, and finding a neceſſity of ſpeaking more afterward.</p>
                        <p>But it will be expected that Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments be rather anſwered, then his concluſion denyed and oppoſed; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine them; as far as I can finde they are in number two, by which he proveth faith to be the condition of juſtification.</p>

Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes it his task again to prove the juſtification of the New Covenant to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall and not abſolute. But ſo poorly doth he there handle his diſpute, ſo unlike Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who when Scriptures fail him, is elſewhere wont to play his game with Sophiſtry
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:167891:204"/> (which here doth very little help him;) that unto a diſcreet man nothing can more breed a ſuſpicion of the goodneſſe of the cauſe, then the hard ſhifts, confuſedneſſe, contradictions, and other weak devices and extravagancies, to which ſo accompliſht a ſcholar is put (even when he hath no opponent but a meer queſtion) to make it ſeem probable. How doth the man put himſelf here into a wood or wilderneſſe, ſeeking but finding no certain way out, acting his wit and ſtudy to the higheſt to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite himſelf in a cleer way that might be viſible and plain to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others? and not finding it, he at laſt doth what may be done in ſuch a labyrinth, truſteth to groping for what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee. And firſt he ſeems to have found in the dark a two-fold Covenant of Grace, one abſolute, and the other conditional. Firſt then he follows the abſolute Covenant, if that will or can lead him with certainty to any ſafety or ſhew of reaſon what to ſpeak of it, as he makes it contradiſtinct to the Conditional Covenant, or Juſtification; that the former which he cannot deny may ſtand as a cipher, but this be the Numeral, and only in power and force: here he is carryed in a maze of doubts and rovings, not finding where to pitch.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. He queſtions whether the Apoſtle mention it as an abſolute promiſe, or elſe in an oppoſition to he knows not what; but foreſeeing what would herein be anſwered, he lets fall this too, <hi>pag.</hi> 42.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He brings ſomething which he thinks will hold water: that this abſolute Covenant of Juſtification is made with the Elect, and not with mankinde in generall. What is this to the purpoſe? He is here treating of the New Covenant as it reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Juſtification. And what one Scripture can he produce that tels us of all mankinde, and not of the Elect only juſtified? In what a ſtraight is the man, that in ſtead of diſtinctions, which were ever wont to be his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed to ſuccour him, he is forced to fly to confuſions for help? For ſo he confounds together here the promulgation of Juſtification with Juſtification in its beeing,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:167891:205"/> or with the being of it, when theſe are different. As well might he pronounce the rich glutton to be no leſſe bleſſed in ſeeing then was <hi>Lazarus</hi> by being in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, as to pronounce all mankinde juſtified, becauſe Chriſt is conditionally offered to all for Juſtification. We have granted before the promulgation and offer of Juſtification by the Goſpel to be conditionall, but the gift and beeing of it to be abſolute. Neither is there any thing in this offer to our Juſtification in Chriſt which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute before and without any promulgation or conditionall offer thereof to us. Nor any thing to the juſtified and actually declared juſt in themſelves: Juſtification is no longer in a conditionall offer to them, but in its abſolute being within them. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore he addeth there <hi>pag.</hi> 43, 44. is wide from the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, being not limited to the Juſtification of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is the ſubject of his Treatiſe, which here he ſhunneth and talketh extravagantly about ſanctification, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confute the abſolute juſtification, but that it doth and will ſtand, and ſtanding will not admit a conditional juſtification to ſtand with it and by it, in its beeing, though the offer thereof (before it is in beeing) be conditionall.</p>
                        <p>And this is all which at length he concludeth <hi>pag.</hi> 45. of the conditionall Covenant of Grace, which without all this circui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been granted him: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is propounded and offered to mankinde conditionally, if they will beleeve, and without this faith none hath or ſhall have the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof to themſelves and in themſelves, becauſe all theſe that do not or ſhall not (being in a capacity to) beleeve are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and as many as are elect ſhall come to Chriſt and beleeve in him, as hath been before ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>What he addeth for the application may have ſome pertinency to the matter there objected, but it hath none to the thing here in queſtion. Therefore I paſſe it by as not concerning us.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 Neither whatſoever it be, is Faith the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of Juſtification, in that ſenſe as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> taketh and defineth it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:167891:205"/> in his ſtricter or larger definition: except he will ſay that no Infants are juſtified, who do not, cannot accept Chriſt, much leſſe ſo beleeve as in his larger definition he ſets forth faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Faith is not the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of our juſtification in God, no nor yet in Chriſts Juſtification (as he tearms it) for theſe are antecedaneous to our faith, and our faith not an antecedent to it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 At the utmoſt it can be but the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of Gods declaring and evidencing of our ſelves to our ſelves juſtified; and this juſtification Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo diſdaineth and ſnuffs at, that he will not own it much leſſe mention it. Yet can he not with all his Sophiſtry name any other act of juſtification in this life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of faith can be proved to be the Antecedent, <hi>Medium,</hi> or <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 Why doth he call faith and all the conqualifications wherewith he loadeth the ſhoulders thereof, and all the works which he makes its Concomitants, the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> as if all theſe with their Colaterall in the other ſcale of his ballance, Chriſts ſatisfaction, did make up the one and ſole <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of our juſtification; can none elſe be named? Beſides other, the weakneſſe and infirmity of the <hi>Law to juſtifie,</hi> as it removes the impediment of juſtifiableneſſe in Gods Court of ſtrict Juſtice: (<hi>For had there been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſſe ſhould have been by the Law, Gal.</hi> 3. 21.) and ſin which removes the ſame impediment, might more properly and ſocially then Chriſts ſatisfaction have been placed on horſeback in the ſame ſaddle of <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> had not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thought Chriſt would bleſſe, but theſe would have defiled this golden ſaddle of his own either making or appropriating to this uſe, and ſo beſpattered and undreſſed the righteouſneſſe of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and good works that they would never more become fit to ride on horsback in proceſſion with the Holy Wafer. Thus his condition and <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> muſt be new modelled ere they will be Canonicall.</p>
                        <p>But ſee we here the mans wit which never fails him at a dead lift. What he cannot act by power he ſeeks to compaſſe by a ſtratagem. Becauſe he cannot cover the nakedneſſe of his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he labors to make bare ours, and caſt filth in it, that having diverted the eyes of his Reader thither, he may forget the vanity of his Condition, or <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> And thus he doth it.</p>

                        <p>It is not for nothing that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> puts here a reſtriction upon juſtification by the Act of faith, limiting it to [<hi>men of age:</hi>] Are then elect infants that die before they attain age and ſtrength of reaſon to put forth their faith into act, juſtifyed only by the habit of faith?

Again, if they are juſtifyed by the habit of faith as a habit of inherent grace, (though not ſuch as he here denyeth to have an excellency above other graces) what difference doth he put between Juſtification and Sanctification? Doth he not ſpeak the ſame things here with the Papiſts? Yea in a higher dialect then any of them? For they grant to Infants juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only by the waſhing of Chriſts bloud conferred upon them in Baptiſm, without any qualification of their own. But this man (if he thus ſay) juſtifies them by an inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of their own. But if Infants are juſtifyed without the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:167891:209"/> act of faith, and yet not by its habit, how are they then <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed but by that which he calleth Chriſts own juſtification as a publick perſon at his reſurrection?</hi> which notwithſtanding he utterly denyed <hi>Theſ.</hi> 42. and its Explication: and if they are ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, will it not follow then that juſtification by the act of faith is Gods declaring and mans applying of his juſtification to his preſent comfort and full aſſurance? (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> explodeth as an unſufferable concluſion) But dying Infants are to have no uſe of this preſent comfort and full aſſurance, therefore it ſufficeth them to be juſtifyed in Chriſt, though not in themſelves. Laſtly, or do they depart hence unjuſtifyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without actuall beleeving and receiving of Chriſt, and ſo ſhall be juſtifyed in the day of judgment, becauſe at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection they ſhall actually beleeve? What a crie do the poor ſouls in the interim then make in that <hi>Limbus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantum?</hi> And why may not then (according to <hi>Origen</hi>) all the Devils and reprobates in hell be then juſtifyed and ſaved alſo, becauſe then they may actually beleeve, and (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) the condition of juſtification laſteth untill that day.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. From the plain and conſtant phraſe of Scripture, which ſaith, he that beleeveth ſhall be juſtifyed, and that we are juſtifyed by faith; and that faith is imputed for righteouſneſſe. It had been as eaſie for the holy Ghoſt to have ſaid, that Christ only is imputed, or his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe only, or Chriſt only juſtifyeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he had ſo meant.

                           <p n="3">3. From the nature of the thing.

                        <p>I ſhall not have need to ſpeak much to this paſſage, becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath before ſaid and I have anſwered to the greateſt part of it in examining his 23. <hi>Theſ.</hi> with the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Here as there I ſhall defend againſt him, that it is not faith as it is righteouſneſſe, but Chriſts righteouſneſſe by which we are ſaid to be juſtifyed.</p>
                        <p>The firſt reaſon which he brings to evince the contradictory and contrary concluſion, hath been there examined, and I will not here <hi>actum agere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the ſecond, 1. He ſhould have quoted that Apocryphal Scripture which ſaith, <hi>He that beleeveth</hi> ſhall be <hi>juſtifyed</hi> (as if he were not already juſtifyed:) I finde it not in the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe Scriptures which ſay we are juſtifyed by faith, ſay not that we are juſtifyed by it as it is our righteouſneſſe, or any part of our juſtifying righteouſneſſe; and thoſe that ſay it is imputed to us (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have it) <hi>for righteouſneſſe,</hi> have been ſufficiently ſpoken to under <hi>Theſis</hi> 23. And by the way Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not ignorant that the originall text may be more properly rendred <hi>unto</hi> or <hi>to</hi> righteouſneſſe then <hi>for righteouſneſſe,</hi> and that the old tranſlation and moſt of our Proteſtant Divines ſo render it, neither have I met with any one that declares his diſlike of that verſion. And from the text ſo read what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can ſuck out to ſtabliſh the righteouſneſſe of faith not as the ſame but as a collaterall with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction to juſtification, I underſtand not.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To his Only, only, and only, I anſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That it is not the firſt time that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath taken the boldneſſe to teach the holy Ghoſt to ſpeak properly and fully.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 When the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>That the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 7. that <hi>whoſoever is waſhed</hi> [therein] <hi>needs no other waſhing, Joh.</hi> 13. 10. that he is the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world, Joh. 1. 29. that by his one offering he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctifyed, by taking away their ſins and iniquities, Heb. 10. 14, 17. That he is made of God righteouſneſſe to us, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. that <hi>he was made ſin for us, that we might become the righteouſneſſe of God in him, 2 Cor. 5. 21. That he
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:167891:210"/> is all in all, Col.</hi> 3. 11. Will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> elude all theſe and a whole century more of the like Scriptures with this evaſion; yea Chriſt hath done, and is all this in part to us, leaving the other part of righteouſneſſe not perfected by him to be ſupplyed by faith his collaterall to our juſtification? Or when it is ſaid, <hi>There is ſalvation in no other, nor any name elſe given us under heaven by which we may be ſaved</hi> beſides Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. and the Apoſtle profeſſeth it his whole labour <hi>to be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith;</hi> ſo making Chriſt put on for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the righteouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith, not ſeverall kinds of righteouſneſſe, but one and the ſame righteouſneſſe which he oppoſeth there to his own inherent righteouſneſſe which he excludeth: are not theſe ſpeeches equipollent to that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> requireth, the Chriſt only, or the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt only? It is but a flouriſh wherewith he concludes this argument, about the conſtant expreſſe phraſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For let him either produce one Scripture that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth faith by any inherent righteouſneſſe in it ſelf, or of her own conveyed into us to contribute ſomewhat to our Juſtification, or elſe confeſſe his errour to be derived from the ſcriblings of <hi>Bellarmine, Socixus, Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> where this Doctrine is to be found, and not from the Scriptures of Gods inſpiration that are wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                        <p>To his third reaſon I can ſay nothing becauſe I underſtand nothing of his meaning therein; or if I doe underſtand it, nothing needs to be ſaid, becauſe it hath nothing for himſelf or againſt us. But to that which he addes of his thinking.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Let him ſay whether by them that (he ſaith) would have faith to be the inſtrument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he doth not mean all the Proteſtant Churches, both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as they are by ſome diſtinguiſhed: whether the beſt that have oppoſed them herein have not been the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and from what <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> theſe firſt drank in their opinion, he is not ignorant having fiſhed in the ſame pools after them.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="368" facs="tcp:167891:211"/>2. When <hi>he thinks</hi> theſe ſhould not <hi>deny that we are properly juſtifyed by faith as an inſtrument:</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 If they will not deny it, will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The word [properly] is <hi>vox aequivoca;</hi> a phraſe may be ſaid to be proper, as it is enough fit and proportioned to declare the meaning of the ſpeaker, and in this ſenſe we deny not that faith as an inſtrument ſubſervient to the principall efficient, doth ſo properly as an inſtrument can, juſtifie us in our ſelves or to our own conſciences.</p>
                        <p>Again, it may be ſaid to be proper in oppoſition to a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall way of ſpeaking: and in this ſenſe we cannot ſay that faith doth ſo properly juſtifie, ſpecially in that extent wherein Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Maſters will have it to juſtifie, without a trope in the phraſe of ſpeaking, which I would ſhew if it were pertinent to the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall ſpare to tranſcribe at large his next ſection which he puts under <hi>n.</hi> 4. of his Explication. Becauſe if he meant ſingly and preciſely as he ſpeaks, all might be granted in a poſitive ſenſe without prejudice to our cauſe or advantage to his; <hi>viz.</hi> that faith doth directly and properly juſtifie in and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe that were before juſtifyed in Chriſt, as it is (in a good ſenſe) the condition of the new Covenant, and a means or inſtrument of Gods ſtamping by his commandement and promiſe to the attainment of this juſtification. For this deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that truth which before he kicked at, that faith doth ſo juſtifie alſo in regard of that uſefull and eſſentiall property which it hath above all other gifts of grace, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall to apprehend Chriſt for righteouſneſſe. Nay even for this cauſe hath God either ordained and commanded faith to this end, becauſe it hath this property, or becauſe he hath ordained and given to it this property, therefore he not only requireth but alſo concurreth with it to bleſſe it, even it alone to this end. Here to determine peremptorily whether of theſe acts of God, his qualifying of faith for, or his commanding it to this uſe, is more and leſſe direct or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the end, or whether they are coordinates thereunto, I fear may proceed more from a headie raſhneſſe then from the modeſty of Chriſtian wiſdome; eſpecially becauſe I take juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:167891:211"/> faith to be more then a naturall or morall virtue, (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> poſſibly will deny) <hi>viz.</hi> an infuſed habit qualifyed by God himſelf that infuſeth it with this peculiar property to cleave unto Chriſt and receive him.</p>
                        <p>But by the way it ſhall not be impertinent to ſhew in ſome particulars what mentall Reſervations Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath in his words, not eaſily appearing to a curſory reader.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When he ſaith,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Faith juſtifyeth, as it is the fulfilling of the condition of the new Covenant.</q>
                        <p>His meaning is, that it only ſo far juſtifyeth as it fulfilleth the condition. But throughout our whole life, according to his principles, we are but fulfilling, have not fulfilled the condition of the new Covenant, therefore throughout our whole life we are but in juſtifying not juſtifyed. And then conſequently (if it be true what moſt of our Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) that in the next life there ſhall be no uſe of faith (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vinon and fruition are proper to that ſtate) beleevers ſhall not be juſtifyed at all, becauſe the condition was never fulfilled.</p>

                        <p>I come now to the fift and laſt Section of his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>pag.</hi> 230.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> 5. That faiths receiving Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and ſecondary and not the formall reaſon why it juſtifyeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth thus.</q>
                        <p>We finde verifyed in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that of the Poet, <hi>Dolus an virtus quis in hoſte requirat?</hi> having profeſſed open warre againſt the doctrine of all the Proteſtant Churches, yea of the Goſpell of Chriſt, he manageth it more by ſtratagems then by valour. We finde him here perverting in ſtead of rightly ſtating the queſtion, thereby to get advantage to anſwer what he will and to what he pleaſeth. The queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted between us and the Papiſts firſt, and in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times the Arminians alſo, is not whether Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith in Chriſt, or elſe the acting of faith ſo inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be the one the formall, and the other the remote reaſon why it juſtifyeth? But whether faith ſo inſtituted of God to be the mean or inſtrument of our Juſtification, doth juſtifie by vertue received from Chriſt its object, or elſe by its own vertue, as it is a good work, or as it is an act of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe performed in obedience to Gods commandement? That which they maintain is that faith juſtifyeth by vertue of its object Chriſt, denying the Papiſts work and the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians act. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did labour more for truth then for victory, we ſhould not finde in him ſo much fraud and ſo little of ſincerity. It is not Chriſts but Antichriſts kingdome that is maintained by the pillarage of ſhifts and ſophiſms. Let him not aſtoniſh the poor Saints of Chriſt with words that they cannot underſtand, obſcuring the truth with needleſſe terms of art; his poor flock of <hi>Keder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> for whom he affirmes himſelf to have compiled this work, are in all probability as well acquainted with the formall and remote reaſon why faith juſtifyeth, as they are with Hocus Pocus his Liegerdemain. In this point let him either confute the aſſertion of our Divines, or maintain the adverſaries aſſertion; here he doth neither directly, but beats the aire and makes a great noiſe to little purpoſe. Yet let us ſee how well he proveth his own aſſertion.</p>
                        <q>
                           <pb n="379" facs="tcp:167891:212"/>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Suppoſe Chriſt had done all that he did for ſinners, and they had beleeved in him thereupon without any Covenant promiſing Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by this Faith, would this Faith have juſtified them? By what Law? or whence will they plead their Juſtification at the Bar of God?</q>
                        <p>This ſuppoſition is not full, there muſt be another ſuppoſition antecedaneous to this ſuppoſition. A true ſuppoſition that will ſhew the invalidity of this feigned one. Suppoſe that upon a foregoing Covenant between the Father and him, Chriſt hath done all this for his elect whom he knoweth by name, and ſo Chriſt in their names hath given and God hath taken full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all their offences, and hereupon Chriſt hath received in their behalf a full acquittance and diſcharge: Who now ſhall lay any thing to their charge? It is God that juſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. under this ſuppoſition they are for ever freed from pleading at Gods Bar: <hi>They have there an Advocate to plead for them, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our ſins, 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. Sits at the right hand of God with the effectuall Oratory of his pretious bloud making interceſſion for us, Rom.</hi> 8. 34. ſo the ſuppoſition of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> extends no further then this, if without any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant promiſe of Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt, could they by beleeving in him have had the beeing and comfort of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within their own ſouls? Unleſſe God had by ſome other way ratified and ſealed this benefit to them, I acknowledge they could not: yet had their juſtification been ſtill nothing the leſſe firm before God in Chriſt. But now by the promiſe of the New Covenant, through Faith they have the ſweetneſſe and joy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in themſelves alſo.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> But ſuppoſe Chriſt having done all that he did for us, that he ſhould in framing the New Covenant have put in any other condition, and ſaid [whoſoever loveth God ſhall by vertue of my ſatisfaction be juſtified] would not this love have juſtified? No doubt of it. I conclude then thus: The receiving of Chriſt is as the ſilver of this coin, the Goſpel promiſe is as the Kings ſtamp which maketh it curraut for juſtifying. If God had ſeen it meet to have ſtamped any thing elſe, it would have paſſed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>We cannot ſo ſuppoſe, for one abſurd ſuppoſition being granted a thouſand more will follow after: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:167891:213"/> too low in his ſuppoſitions. Let him here advance a ſtair higher with us, and ſuppoſe firſt a truth, before he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that which is falſe and unpoſſible in reſpect of that truth that muſt neceſſarily be preſuppoſed: <hi>viz.</hi> That God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Covenanting with man had decreed within himſelf (<hi>Salva Juſtitia,</hi> without obſcuring at all his Juſtice) <hi>to make known on the veſſels of mercy (i. e.</hi> in juſtifying and ſaving miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners whom he had before prepared to glory) <hi>the riches of his glory, i. e.</hi> the praiſe of the glory of grace, <hi>Rom. 9. 23. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. that himſelf and his free grace ſhould be all, and man nothing to his juſtification and ſalvation; and to the end that his juſtice might appear ſtill in all its luſtre, had taken full ſatisfaction from his own Son: here to manifeſt the freeneſſe of his grace, the all to our happineſſe reſiding in his meer mercy, and the nothing in our ſelves, I ſee not what other condition or means beſides faith God could have put, out of which mans proud heart would not have arrogated ſomething to himſelf to have ſwoln therewith, and ſo the glory of Gods grace, ſhould have been obſcured. Or doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſee farther then the Apoſtle? He tels us, <hi>It is of Faith that it might be by</hi> Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. If by other means it might have been, and yet by grace there would be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flaw in the Apoſtles arguing, which limits it to faith that it might be of grace. To the ſame purpoſe are thoſe many Scriptures in which he affirms it to be by faith that all mans boaſting may be excluded, implying that if it had not been only by faith, there would have been ſomething of man in it clowding the glory of Gods grace, and giving to man occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of boaſting that there is ſomething of his own to his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſo to glory partly in himſelf and not wholly in the Lord. So Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> arguing, <hi>If God had put ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no doubt it would have juſtified;</hi> is one and the ſame with this; <hi>If God had acted againſt his own purpoſe, and betrayed the glory of his Grace, no doubt it had been betrayed.</hi> But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſuppoſition is no leſſe abſurd then the latter. And almoſt ſo much at the full, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> either to toll on his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into more ſnares which afterward he layeth, by his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent elogies of Gods grace, or from the throws and checks of an accuſing conſcience; ſpeaketh in the following part of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:167891:213"/> this Section. Yet ſo that he cannot ceaſe from the interweav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mans works with Gods grace unto Juſtification: which becauſe he doth more fully and groſſely in the following part of this Tractate, I ſhall here forbear to anticipate what there is to be ſaid by way of anſwer to him. The next Poſition is of neer cognation with this; his words are theſe:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <label>B. Theſis 58.</label> The ground of this is; becauſe Chriſts righteouſneſſe doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us properly and formally becauſe we beleeve or receive it; but becauſe it is ours in Law, by divine donation or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This is plain in it ſelf, and in that which is ſaid before.</p>
                        <p>How this is plain in that which is ſaid before, we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examined; how it is plain in it ſelf we are here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine. To omit how after Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Principles the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt can be ſaid to be ours by divine donation and imputation, when he holds it no otherwiſe by Gods dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ours, then the wilde Gooſe is his: his, if he can catch her, and as long as he can hold her: ſo his as it is every ones elſe as well as his if they can take and hold her. For ſhe is the worlds Gooſe, and proper to no one before one hath taken her, and no longer that ones then while he holds her, if he let her go ſhe is the worlds Gooſe again. If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> righteouſneſſe be ſtabliſhed upon ſuch a law, donation, and imputation, let it be his, not mine, I ſhall not contend with him for a ſhare in it, becauſe the Lord offers me a righteouſneſſe of <hi>a better Covenant eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better promiſes, Heb.</hi> 8. 6. But to let this paſſe; When M. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith <hi>the ground of this is; what meaneth he by this?</hi> That no doubt that went before in the former Poſition. But in it are many things, and which of them is plain upon this ground in his meaning I cannot eaſily judge, becauſe to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no one of them is upon this ground plain. Nay upon this ground no man living is juſtified in this world. For it is not ours, ſaith he, by beleeving and receiving it, but by divine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; And this donation he will not have to be confirmed, untill all the conditions be compleated, and that is not untill the world be ended. But to give my beſt conjecture of his meaning, I think he will be underſtood that the two laſt clauſes of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Theſis</hi> are plain upon this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Faith
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:167891:214"/> doth juſtifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> properly as a condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Improperly as it doth receive Chriſt. The ground ſaith he is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here by the way we may take notice of the mans ſubtilty and ſophiſtry, in ſhifting from one tearm of Art to another, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 57. he tels us that faith doth [<hi>properly</hi>] juſtifie thus, and [<hi>improperly</hi>] thus; but in the Explication, he foyſteth in the word <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>formall, pag.</hi> 230, 231. and here <hi>Theſ.</hi> 58. puts both together, properly and formally, as if there were no other proper cauſe and reaſon but the formall cauſe and reaſon of a thing, and that every proper cauſe were the formall cauſe. And thus whatſoeverr Scripture ſaith illiterately, Chriſt himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> proper language, ſhould not be a proper cauſe of our juſtification. And who ſees not the end of this his project? If he be put to it, he layes a ground for the diverting of the whole diſpute from the Scriptures, unto Philoſophy, Logick, and the Metaphyſicks, where there may be a cavill about the nature of the formall cauſe, ſo long untill both ſides be out of breath, and in the end both parties be as wiſe to Juſtification as in the beginning. This is the calamity of the Church in theſe times, that they which hold themſelves the chief Doctors and eminent lights thereof, darken every ſacred truth with the miſt of humane Learning caſt upon it, in ſtead of clearing it to the comprehenſion of Gods babes and ſucklings. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then if the juſtice of God hath ſtirred up among us ſo many Earth-born and Earth-bred Meteors, perſons of no learning, (Ranters and Enthuſiaſts I mean) like <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe to rebuke the madneſſe of theſe Prophets. And doubtleſſe either by theſe or ſome other the Lord will prevail againſt them, if they ſhall not ceaſe to pervert with <hi>Elymas</hi> the plain ways of God.</p>
                        <p>Now to the matter it ſelf about which his ſophiſtry hath bin oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant. In theſe two Poſitions, <hi>viz</hi> and 57, &amp; 58. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> aym is at two aſſertions of the Proteſtants to ſmite them through, <hi>viz.</hi> the inſtrumentality of Faith, and the vertue which it deriveth from Chriſts it object, to juſtifie and to ſet up his <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Credere</hi> or act of beleeving under the name of a condition of the New Covenant without any reſpect of inſtrumentality that it hath to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt, or any vertue that it receives from Chriſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:167891:214"/> to juſtifie. This he doth in the laſt words of the 57. <hi>Theſis,</hi> telling us that <hi>faith</hi> can be ſaid only <hi>in a remote and improper ſenſe,</hi> as it <hi>receiveth Chriſt, to juſtifie;</hi> where by receiving he ſhaketh and ſhifts off the inſtrumentality of faith, and by Chriſt the vertue of faiths object, into a remote and darke corner as not working at all or very obſcurely in our juſtification. But his act of beleeving he exalteth as the proper and formall reaſon of faiths juſtifying. This he illuſtrateth in the Explication <hi>pa.</hi> 230. Suppoſe Chriſt had put ſome other condition of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as Love, Patience, Temperance, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that could not be inſtruments of receiving Chriſt, nor have Chriſt their object to draw vertue from him: ſhould not either of theſe notwithſtanding though neither inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor in a capacity to have Chriſt their object from which to have drawn vertue, by their own act have juſtifyed? So faith being the condition of the new Covenant doth by its act juſtifie. So argued he under <hi>Theſ.</hi> 57.</p>
                        <p>But doubting of the validity of his reaſons there either to weaken ours, or to ſtabliſh his own aſſertion, he addes this <hi>Theſis</hi> more fully to confirm what he had there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured.</p>
                        <p>The ground of this is (ſaith he) becauſe, and becauſe; as is before expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, there is no ſufficient ground laid for the confuting of ours, or the ſtrengthning of his tenent. For be it that Chriſts righteouſneſſe be ours by divine donation or imputation, how doth he build his opinion upon this ground, that the act of faith as being the condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth properly juſtifie? He muſt ſhew his meaning in words at length and not in figures, before he ſhall win us to build with him ſtraw and ſtubble upon the ground; that is good and fitted to bear a good ſtructure. But very remarkably doth he here diſpute in oppoſing Gods dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or giving, or our beleeving or receiving of Chriſts righteouſneſſe as if they could not both conſiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in juſtifying us, at leaſt properly. Then it ſeems
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:167891:215"/> we are properly juſtifyed by the donation of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>credere</hi> or act of faith. Yea then are we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and formally juſtifyed in Chriſt before we yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved: For he will not denie that Gods donation of Chriſt (at leaſt in his ſenſe) is before our receiving him. And thus with one breath he will throw down all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſo much labour he hath built.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſee how from this ground he batters our aſſertions, and what force there is in his battery. If we look to the <hi>Protheſis</hi> of his <hi>Theſis</hi> alone, the argument in ſubſtance runs to this Tenour, Faith doth not juſtifie us either as an inſtrument, or by vertue of Chriſt; or Chriſts righteouſneſſe its object; becauſe it doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us as an inſtrument or by vertue of its object. Who can ſhake his buildings that founds them on ſuch firme ground? That this is the force of his reaſoning is evident to them that obſerve him, that by the word [receiving] he excludes the inſtrumentality, and by [Chriſt] excludes the object of faith from any proper acting to juſtifie us, as I ſaid before. But we will annex the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> to his <hi>Protheſis,</hi> and ſo fill up his <hi>Theſis,</hi> and then ſee what ſtrength there is in the whole to his advantage, or our diſadvantage. What he muſt prove in his and refute on our part, hath been already declared. Only in the forecited <hi>Protheſis</hi> he begs the concluſion, that he ſhould have proved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt lay his whole argument from the donation or imputation alone: yet will we put his Argument fully thus, If Chriſts righteouſneſſe doth not properly juſtifie us becauſe we beleeve or receive it, but becauſe it is ours in Law by Gods imputation or donation, then faith doth not juſtifie as an inſtrument or by vertue of Chriſt its object, but as it is an act containing the condition of the Covenant. But the former is true, therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo.</p>
                        <p>I deny the aſſumption as to the former member thereof, the beleeving and receiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> brings not ſo much as a <hi>gry</hi> to prove it. And as to the latter mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Gods donation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deny the conſequent of the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:167891:215"/> Major, Though Chriſts righteouſneſſe juſtifie us proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is ours in Law by Gods donation or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet it followes not that either faith as an act or condition doth ſo of it ſelf juſtifie, or that it doth not juſtifie as an inſtrument and by vertue of its object, or as ſome ſay, its correlate, or as others by the communion that it puts us into with Chriſt: this I prove thus, not from terms of art, but from the authority and teſtimonies of the moſt high God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the relation between the brazen Serpent the Type, and Chriſt Jeſus the Antitype; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. The brazen Serpent was of Gods donation to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo alſo was the Soveraigne power that was infuſed into it to heal; but the eyes of the wounded <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt be directed unto, and fixed upon the Serpent for cure, and then vertue iſſued from it to heal. So was the ſon of man lifted up with vertue in him to heal. Chriſt with this vertue is of Gods donation, yet this donation hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that our faith as an inſtrument muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to, and fixed upon him alone for juſtification, and ſo that juſtifying vertue or righteouſneſſe in him comes from him upon us to juſtification. It is no more the act of faith that of it ſelf becauſe a condition (if indeed a condition) doth it, then the act of the eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cured the wounded without vertue drawn by it from its object.</p>

                        <p>I proceed to the next poſition.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <label>B. Theſis 59.</label> Juſtification is not a Momentaneous act, begun and ended immediately upon our beleeving, but a continued act; which though it be in its kind compleat from the firſt' yet it is ſtill in doing till the finall juſtification in the judgment day.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>All this together with moſt of the Explication may be granted as being capable of an Orthodox ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That juſtification as an act immanent in God is ſuch as is here deſcribed is confeſſed. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is deaf in this ear.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="387" facs="tcp:167891:216"/>2. That our juſtification in Chriſt is ſuch (in ſome ſenſe) we alſo grant, but neither will he liſten to this.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore if he would take off all ambiguity of his words, and declare his ſenſe to be the ſame with the ſound, we would grant to him alſo that ſuch is our perſonall juſtification in our ſelves, which he owneth only for juſtification. For as it is an act of God it is never interrupted or diſſolved till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though as it is taken Paſſively, there may be many interruptions of our ſenſe and apprehenſion of it.</p>
                        <p>But his <hi>Theſis</hi> is faced like <hi>Janus,</hi> lookes two wayes at once, is ſet forth in ſuch words as will more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit of an evill then a good ſenſe. And that he ſpeaks them after the Remonſtrant, not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant dialect, is too probable though not infallibly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from theſe reaſons, to be meant in an evill ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe he delivers it in the Arminian phraſe. For ſo his St. <hi>Epiſcopius, Juſtificatio eſt actus continuus qui eſt</hi>

To the continuance of juſtification Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here ſpeaketh the ſame thing with him, and though as to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it he ſpeaks here as out of a cloud, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with this his 45. <hi>Theſis</hi> and you will have the whole of <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> from the pen of Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe his words do ſeem here to ſuppoſe a <hi>Magis &amp; minus</hi> in its active acceptation or ſenſe. <hi>It is not begun and ended immediately,</hi> ſaith he, but is ſtill in doing [in a way of perfecting] untill the judgment day.</p>

                           <pb n="388" facs="tcp:167891:217"/>3. His reſtriction added to the compleatneſſe or perfection thereof at the firſt. <hi>It is compleat at firſt,</hi> ſaith he but <hi>in its kind,</hi> which reſtriction makes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe of juſtification incompleat, and its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imperfect till the day of judgment, as himſelfe hath expreſſed himſelfe before <hi>Theſis</hi> 41. Theſe things from the poſition it ſelf. From the explication will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The heartleſſe and comfortleſſe proof that he brings to prove the continuance of this juſtifying act, making it to reach only to the <hi>Genera ſingulorum,</hi> not to the <hi>ſingula generum:</hi> to ſuch a kinde of men, not to any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man, or individuall perſon upon earth: to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,</hi> but not to this or that beleever. So that the holieſt Saint if at any time his faith in ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion faint, and cannot be brought to ſenſible acting, is left deſtitute of all comfort from the Goſpell or new Covenant after Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> principles. It juſtifieth onely ſo long as faith actually receiveth Chriſt; if faith through infirmity ceaſe to act, he gives the diſtreſſed ſoul no comfort that God continueth to juſtifie.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. From the firſt uſe of inſtruction which he draweth from this poſition. This <hi>ſheweth us</hi> (ſaith he) in the firſt place, <hi>with what limitation to receive the aſſertion of our Divines, that remiſſion and juſtification, are</hi> ſimul <hi>and</hi> ſemel, <hi>performed:</hi> his meaning is, that we muſt underſtand them in this aſſertion to deal as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is wont, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſay one thing and mean another. Not to think as they ſpeak, but to equivocate and retaine a mentall reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation within themſelves. That our juſtification is begun and perfected both at once and together, but all this is but <hi>ſuo genere,</hi> in its kinde; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, even as the Uſurer frankly and freely forgave to his debtor all that he owed him, but with this limitation that if he were not paid the whole debt to day, he would caſt him in priſon to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:167891:217"/> there to lie untill he ſhould pay the whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is diſpoſed here to liſp and not to ſpeak alowd and plain his minde, we ſhall leave him to his humour, and proceed to hearken to him where he ſpeaketh plainly and without parables.</p>

                           <p>The following Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Book reduced to ſome few heads, and the queſtion between him and the Proteſtants about Juſtification by works ſtated.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we have been buſied about the view of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſwelling, which the more and the farther we gazed on, the more it increaſed, and after a long expectation of an iſſue, at length the impoſthumated matter breaks out in the ſight of all men, to the offence of all ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed men, <hi>Juſtification by workes.</hi> This is the declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Subject of all the following part of this Treatiſe, what before he did but hint and whiſper in a kind of darkeneſſe, now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167891:220"/> he preacheth on the top of the houſe, proclaiming it as the ſole <hi>Soul-ſaving</hi> doctrine, canonizing as Saints the Papiſts for the conſtant holding forth of it, and Anathematizing all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Churches as Apoſtaticall for departing from it, as by examining what followes in this his Tractate will appear.</p>
                        <p>For the avoiding of confuſion, and prevention of a volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous prolixity, into which I ſee my ſelf already carried by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him Theſis after Theſis, (being neceſſitated thereby as he ſpeaks, ſo to examine and anſwer the ſame things often in many places;) I ſhall endeavour to reduce unto ſome few heads, the ſum of what he ſaith upon this Queſtion, examining that which is to the purpoſe, and leaving the reſt that is inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or impertinent to it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Then I ſhall endeavour to draw out from him the ſtate of the Queſtion what he holdeth, and how he holds it forth to us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 I ſhall examine his Arguments and Reaſons, by which he endeavoureth to confirme his aſſertion or aſſertions.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 I ſhall alſo examine what force there is in the Reaſons which he bringeth to clear himſelf and his doctrine from being derogatory to the grace of God and full efficacy of Chriſts mediation; or from all tainture of Popery, Socinianiſm, or other hereſies. Within this Triangle I conceive the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of his doctrine of workes to be comprehended; and in examining of theſe fully, nothing to be left unexamined, that may make for his purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>1 The ſtate of the Queſtion, or his aſſertions which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, I ſhall (as neer as may fitly be done) tranſcribe from him in his own words: thus,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>The bare act of beleeving is not the only condition of the new Covenant but ſeverall other duties alſo are part of this condition, [viz. of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>] (For this is his meaning, and if he be not ſo underſtood, he is underſtood beſides his meaning, and in what he ſaith he ſaith nothing. His Tractate contains Aphoriſms of Juſtification only. And the conditions of the new Covenant which tend to Illumination, Sanctification, Glorification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt not be confounded with thoſe of Juſtification; if it were granted him, that the Goſpell diſpenſeth all or any of theſe upon conditions. In this ſenſe therefore he muſt, he will be underſtood.) <hi>Theſ. 60. pa.</hi> 235.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:167891:220"/>2 That theſe duties coordinate with Faith to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as conditions thereof, are Repentance, praying for pardon, forgiving others, love, hearing the word, conſideration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, godly ſorrow, knowledge of Chriſt, aſſent to the truth of the Goſpell, ſubjection, conſent, acceptance, cordiall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, ſelf-reſigning, eſteeming and preferring Chriſt before all, loving him above all, ſincerity, perſeverance, affiance, ſincere obedience, and works of love, ſerious, painfull and conſtant uſe of Gods ordinances; hearing, praying, meditating; in a word, all good works, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the works of Righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Law requireth: [yet with this proviſo that all theſe legall workes muſt be called not our Legall but our Goſpell Righteouſneſſe.] <hi>Theſ. 60. p. 235, 236. &amp; p. 240, 241, 242. &amp; Theſ. 73, 74, p.</hi> 289. 290, 291, 292.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That the non-performance of any one of theſe doth hinder, but it is not one or many, but a concurrence of all theſe together in one, that ſufficeth to condition us unto Juſtification, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 61. So that when the promiſe of life is made in Scripture to our beleeving in Chriſt, or to any other inſeparable concomitant of Faith, you muſt underſtand it <hi>Caeteris paribus, viz.</hi> that your knowledge, repentance, obedience, good workes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not an inch behind your faith; or in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Faith, hath all other vertues not only included in it, but alſo actuated, and cooperating with it for juſtification, or elſe you muſt be ſhaken off unjuſtified; yea though all the reſt be in act and but one out of act, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 61. and its Explication. He ſaith not this indeed <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> word by word: But let him deny the leaſt particle of all this to be his meaning, he ſhall by ſuch a denyall extremely wound, if not wholly ſubvert his cauſe, and yeeld it to us.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 It is not the habit of theſe vertues as infuſed from above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but the act or work of them as ſet in operation by us, that juſtifieth.

                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 That ſome of theſe juſtifying vertues or works, are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous to, or fore-going preparatives of, ſome integrall parts, ſome proper, eſſentiall, formall acts, ſome differentiall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>In theſe particulars I take the whole ſum of his doctrine about this Queſtion to be comprehended. He addeth indeed ſome leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives here and there to mitigate and make tolerable the aſperity and harſhneſſe of theſe his aſſertions, which we ſhall examine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reaſons that he brings to manifeſt his doctrine not to be derogatory from the glory of Gods grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being more proper to that then this place.

                        </p>
                        <p>In oppoſition to this, all the Proteſtant Churches do and ſtill have maintained that Faith alone, and the ſame not as it is in the conſideration of a habit or vertue, or as an act of ours, but by way of a means or inſtrument (as hath been before explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) juſtifyeth, without any concurrence of works with it in the act and office of juſtifying.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> preface to his firſt Argument drawn from Scriptures to prove Juſtification by works, examined; and the Scriptures which the Proteſtant writers bring againſt it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have ſtifled in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, here brought to light; together with the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt eminent Proteſtant writers upon this Subject.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HIS firſt argument is drawn from Scriptures, unto which he thus prefaceth,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B. 235.</hi> I deſire no more of thoſe that deny this, but that Scripture may be judge: and that they will put by no one Text to that end produced, till they can give ſome other commodious, and not forced interpretation.</q>
                        <p>We gladly accept this rule of diſpute, and pronounce all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rules in Queſtions of this kinde to be irregular. Yet have we ſomewhat to ſay to the propoſer of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Why hath he in the former part of this Tractate ſo much wandered from the rule of Scripture as inſufficient or improper to try his opinions, and make uſe (in ſtead of it) of ſo much exotick learning, the Jeſuits ſophiſtry, and <hi>Socinus</hi> his right reaſon, as if the Scripture were not, but theſe were to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on as proper Judges in ſuch matters?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 When all the Scriptures which he here bringeth to prove a cooperation of workes with faith to juſtification (ſcarce any one of them excepted, as I undertake if he call me to it to ſhew) have been alleaged by the Monkes and Jeſuits againſt us, and been anſwered over and over a hundred times by our Divines; why doth he here urge them as Scriptures of his own collection, and require an interpretation to be given to them that might manifeſt they hold not forth Juſtification by works? how doth he abaſe the Miniſters his readers, for whoſe ſeducing he hath compiled this Book, by imprinting within himſelfe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167891:222"/> a ſuppoſition, that their Libraries conſiſt only of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Schibler,</hi> and that they are as ignorant of the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Papiſts and us, as they were born? Elſe if he ſuppoſed they had read ſuch controverſies, he would not have called for an interpretation of theſe Scriptures as now firſt alleaged by himſelfe. Simplicity in handling the truths of Chriſt is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to declare the heart upright. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had poſſeſſed ſuch a jewell within his boſome, he would have exploded all tricks of ſubtlety and craft with an <hi>Anathema Maranatha;</hi> and told us plainly, theſe Scriptures have been urged by the Papiſts for their juſtification by works, that the Proteſtants have ſaid ſomewhat to elude the force of ſuch Scriptures by forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of them, but againſt every interpretation of every ſuch Scripture, he thus and thus excepteth, and deſireth theſe exceptions of his to be anſwered, elſe he cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced but that works cooperate with faith to Juſtification. But in the midſt of a room that is hung with a thouſand candles and torches, to cry out, O that ſome one would give me one ſpark of light in this dark dungeon! this is no leſſe then to pronounce all ſave himſelf within the room blind, that in the midſt of light they ſee nothing. Or otherwiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all theſe lights darkneſſe in compariſon of his more ſhining light. Let not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo contemn all the <hi>Anti-papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> worthies as ſmoaking ſnuffs in compariſon of his beames; nor think all his yoak-fellowes in the Miniſtry at the preſent to be ſuch glow-wormes and ſlimy ſots, that being thus ſpitted with his baſe <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>eſteem of them, they ſhould be inſenſible of it, and goe away rejoycing, as ſprinkled with his holy water.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Why doth he only quote Scriptures and bring for himſelf and againſt us only Arithmeticall figures and ciphers, without the words of thoſe Scriptures, and telling us how they make for him &amp; againſt us? would he have us to underſtand that he means to argue from them no otherwiſe then the Prieſts and Jeſuites have done before him? we might then anſwer all in a word by ſending him to thoſe pretious ſervants of Chriſt who have anſwered the Argumentations of theſe Prieſts and Jeſuites from theſe Scriptures. Or is it to ſtraighten us with a doubtfulneſſe, what to anſwer, becauſe we know not how he will argue from theſe Scriptures? and to reſerve to himſelf an advantage to except
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167891:222"/> againſt all our anſwers, that we have not ſpoken to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he meant not ſo, but thus and thus to have argued from theſe Teſtimonies. What better anſwer to ſuch a roving diſputer, then to leave him roving, untill he will ceaſe from circling, and fall upon ſome point wherein he will declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he would be anſwered? This I ſhould do, had it been my only purpoſe to have anſwered Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> but becauſe my aime was and is leaſt to grapple with him, (from whom I expect nothing better but many things worſe, after all wiſer mens endeavours then mine, [and could ſhew reaſon for it]) but chiefly to preſerve the ſingle hearted Chriſtians free from his infection; I ſhall not wholly paſſe by, without examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe Scriptures, that none by the miſunderſtanding of Scriptures may be carryed into Anti-ſcripturall errors.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 But how ſeaſonable is the Caution that he gives us, to take heed of giving any uncommodious or forced interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe Scriptures which the Papiſts, and after them the Socinians have urged for their juſtification by workes? As if all our Divines and Martyrs for Chriſt in theſe laſt 200. years have abuſed the Seriptures with falſe interpretations, and ſo have been Apoſtates from Chriſt in departing from <hi>Rome:</hi> and that the Jeſuits and Socinians have been the only ſincere interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Scriptures: when contrariwiſe all that have but looked over the pale into their writings, find nothing ſo ſacred, no Scripture ſo plain which they do not violate and diſtort with their Sophiſticall cavillations. That Hell it ſelf hath in no age vomited out any brood of hereticks that can parallell theſe in audacious abuſe and violation of Scriptures; yet while Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> fights with their Arguments and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains their aſſertions, he cals upon us, <hi>Take heed, abuſe not Scriptures.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:167891:223"/> Papiſts have to ſay againſt them, that both ſides may be heard? But to make a roar on the one ſide, and to exhibit the other party as mute as fiſhes, having nothing to ſay, or reaſon to give for their own Religion, nor to gainſay the adverſaries in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it; is this fair and Chriſtian dealing? Thus to ſtifle our cauſe, or rather the cauſe of Chriſt in darkeneſſe, and to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the light by which we have walked from the time of <hi>Luther</hi> untill this day, what doth it argue in him leſſe then what Chriſt tels us, <hi>He that doeth evill hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds which are evill ſhould be reproved? Joh.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, let us come now to the Scripture, making it the Judge and touchſtone in this Controverſie: But ſo, as that it ſhall be requiſite for me to ſupply what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath left untouched, what Scriptures our Divines bring to prove juſtification to be only by faith, and to deny all cooperation of works therein. And herein I ſhall put limits to my ſelf not letting out all that they produce, (for ſo ſhould I offend with immoderate length) but ſome particulars, that the weakeſt reader may ſee, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would not give him to ſee, that our Churches are not deſtitute of ſtrong grounds for the bearing up of their faith and aſſertions. And when this is done, I ſhall deſcend to examine the force of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures quoted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to ſee whether they make for him, and againſt us.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin from the reaſoning of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 3. 20. &amp;c.</hi> having before proved both the Jews by and under the Law, and the Gentiles without the Law, to be guilty before God; he concludes, <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtifyed,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ver. 21. The righteouſneſſe of God</hi> [viz. to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation] <hi>is manifeſted without the Law, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets (to wit,</hi> a righteouſneſſe which the Law is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, the righteouſneſſe or life which is by faith. From this righteouſneſſe the tenour of the Law or legall Covenant turns aſide, telling us, <hi>he that doeth them ſhall live in them, Gal. 3. 11, 12.) ver. 22. Even the righteouſneſse of God which is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all and upon all that beleeve.</hi> Lo here it is denyed to be by the moſt righteous works which the moſt perfect Law of God himſelf preſcribeth, and attained by faith only, <hi>ver. 24. Being juſtifyed freely by his grace, through the redemption which is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:167891:223"/> by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> what can be ſaid more fully? It ſhall not be impertinent to annote briefly out of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> what he hath upon<note place="margin">Hier. zanch De natura Dei Lib. 4. Cap. 2.

Therefore ſaith he, he excludeth all works, that he may conclude our Juſtification to be by grace alone. Yea more, the Apoſtle (ſaith he) not contented to ſay we are juſtifyed by grace, addeth thereto <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>his grace,</hi> that is, by the grace which is in God, not by any gift of grace infuſed by him into ourſelves, that it might be wholly of God and not of our ſelves at all in the leaſt part. Yea not contented with all this he addeth <hi>freely,</hi> to notifie that there is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any work or qualification on our part to put us into the poſſeſſion thereof, for ſo it ſhould not be wholly by the <hi>free and naked favour of God,</hi> as he tearms it. And laſtly he addeth <hi>by the redemption which is by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by this work of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all ours; hitherto that profound <hi>Zanchius.</hi> Neither cannot it be freely by the redemption of Chriſt, if our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and conditions be brought to intereſſe us to it, for ſo ſhould we be in ſome kinde purchaſers and not receive it freely. The Apoſtle proceeds, <hi>ver. 25. Whom God hath ſet forth as a propitiation through faith in his bloud to declare his righteouſneſse for the remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c.</hi> The whole thing of Gods ordination to make the redemption, propitiation and remiſſion of ſinnes which is by Chriſt, actually ours to our comfort, is here aſſigned to be ſaith in his blood, and not any foregoing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, or ſubſequent vertue or duty of ours annexed to it; and all <hi>to declare his righteouſneſſe. Ver. 26. His righteouſneſſe</hi> (he ſaith again) <hi>that he may be juſt and the juſtifyer of him that beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> fancy ſtand of the Legall righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, and the Evangelicall righteouſneſſe in us; the Apoſtles aſſignation of the end of Gods juſtifying us by Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:167891:224"/> ſhould be maimed. For he ſhould have ſaid, To declare, to declare I ſay his righteouſneſſe, and our righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt and a juſtifyer, and we might be juſt and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyers of our ſelves. And then we are to expunge the next verſe, Where is boaſting then? it is excluded; by what law? of works? nay but by the law of faith. For boaſting ſhould not be at all excluded, if our works ſhould bear a part with faith in juſtifying: ſo ſhould we have matter of glorying in our ſelves ſtill. How full is the Apoſtle here in the confirmation of Juſtification by faith without works? had he ſeen what the Papiſts and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> over their ſhoulders would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt it, he could not have ſpoken more punctually. Yet as I know what the Papiſts ſay for themſelves, ſo I am not ignorant what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will except for himſelf. But I reſerve the Examination thereof for another place where he goeth about to purge his doctrine from all contrariety that it hath to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, and from any derogation from the Grace of God.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond Teſtimonie or authority from Scripture we may draw from <hi>Rom. 4. 1, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall be ſhort in it. The Apoſtle here denies,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Our father Abraham the father of the faithfull</hi> himſelf <hi>to have been juſtifyed by works, for then he ſhould have whereof to glory, ver.</hi> 2, 3. But as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ſo all the faithfull are juſtifyed by faith without works; or to render the words of the Text, By faith and not by works. Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath no evaſion, as in the former Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that the works of the Law only are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was under the promiſe, not under the Law, nether was the Law then given; and the promiſe, under which he was, was without all condition of works; ſo that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here excludeth works indefinitely: I mean not good and evill works, for no man ever brought evill works as evill to be thereby juſtifyed. But good works, whether Legall or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, all acts and deeds both of naturall and infuſed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 In affirming of him <hi>that worketh, i. e.</hi> that ſeeketh juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works, that <hi>the reward is reckoned of debt to him,</hi> that he requires it as due, and ſhall not receive it if it be not found due in Juſtice; but to him <hi>that worketh not, but beleeveth on him that juſtifyeth the ungodly, his faith is imputed to righteouſneſſe, i. e.</hi> as hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:167891:224"/> been already evinced, Chriſt by faith apprehended is of the free grace of God made righteouſneſſe to him. When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> therefore claps his bundle of works upon the ſhoulders of faith to officiate with it to juſtification, he teacheth us to reject the grace of God, and to exact at Gods hands both the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and the end of it our ſalvation, as a debt and due in juſtice. The Apoſtle puts no medium here either between faith and works, or between grace and debt; where workes peep up with faith to juſtifie in any degree, faith is deſtroyed, grace rejected; works alone ſtand pleading for juſtification and ſalvation at the barre of Gods juſtice, from thence alone God heareth the plea of works; in vain is it to plead them at the throne of grace, there nothing elſe but the plea of faith in Chriſt is heard and excepted, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 In deſcribing the righteouſneſſe of juſtification to be <hi>a righteouſneſſe without works, a bleſſedneſſe conſiſting in the covering, forgiving and not imputing of ſin, ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8. ſo that to obtrude works with faith into the office of juſtifying, is to ſubvert Gods juſtification, and erect our own, <hi>i. e.</hi> our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. From all his precedent reaſoning the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace:</hi> and left this ſhould be taken for a juſtification peculiar to <hi>Abraham</hi> and not common to all beleevers, he addeth, <hi>that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed &amp;c. which is of the faith of Abraham:</hi> as before he had ſaid, <hi>that he might be the father of all them that beleeve, that righteouſneſſe might be imputed to them alſo: even to them which walke in the ſteps of the faith of our father Abraham, ver.</hi> 11, 12. And again afterwards, <hi>ver. 23. It was not written for his ſake alone that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we beleeve in him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, ver.</hi> 24. In all which places though faith and beleeving alone are named, yet are they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in oppoſition to and with an excluſion of works: as the attentive reader of that chapter will eaſily perceive.</p>
                        <p>Not to fill up the paper with any other <hi>ſeries</hi> or body of diſputation which the Scriptures plentifully afford for the confirmation of our doctrine, I ſhall only annex ſome ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red teſtimonies thereof compleatly proving the ſame. The whole ſtream of the Goſpell runs this way; <hi>We that are Jewes by nature</hi> [in covenant with God] <hi>and not ſinners of the Gentiles,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:167891:225"/> Knowing that a man is not juſtifyed by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt that we might be juſtifyed by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law, &amp;c. Gal.</hi> 2. 15, 16. By the poſition of faith works are here depoſed. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt, Epheſ. 2. 8, 9. Not of works, but of him that calleth, Rom. 9. 11. Not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy, Rom. 9. 16. Not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy, Tit. 3. 5. This is the work of God,</hi> [that which is in ſtead of all works, and effectual to juſtification without all works] <hi>to beleeve in him whom he hath ſent, Joh. 6. 29. They which are of faith are the children of Abraham, and bleſſed with our father Abraham, for as many as are of the works of the Law are curſed, Gal. 3. 7, 9, 10. Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, Act. 16. 31. Not by the Law of works, for it is written, The juſt ſhall live by faith, Gal. 3. 11. If by grace, then it is no more of works, elſe grace ſhould be no more grace: if of works then, it is no more grace, elſe ſhould work be no more work, Rom.</hi> 11. 6. Hence is the oppoſition which the holy Ghoſt every where maketh between <hi>Gods righteouſneſſe and our righteouſneſſe, Rom. 10. 3. The righteouſneſſe of faith and the righteouſneſſe of works, Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. and the conſenting harmony of Scriptures that ſo oppoſe Law and Goſpell, faith and works, Gods grace and mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the righteouſneſſe which is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that which conſiſts in doing, Gods imputation and our qualifications; ſo that if the one be admitted the other muſt be excluded from juſtification. Unto which if I ſhould add all of the the reſt Teſtimonies and examples of Scripture, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Arguments which our Divines bring thence, I ſhould (to uſe Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> phraſe) be neceſſitated to tranſcribe almoſt all the Scripture that relateth to the New Covenant.</p>
                        <p>The concluſion therefore of our Divines is not only that works have not, but alſo that they connot have any place in or to our Juſtification, becauſe righteouſneſſe and life are meerly and <hi>wholly by promiſe, even by the free and abſolute promiſe made to Abraham, which was without all conditions annexed, Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 16, 17. 18. therefore without works, freely conferred on the children of the promiſe. That they are <hi>by inheritance,</hi> therefore deſcend freely upon them that are ſons by ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18.

                           <hi>Heb. 9. 15. Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 114, 16. and not attained by works. That in reſpect of the righteouſneſſe of works, <hi>Paul knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himſelfe, wherein he was not perfectly ſincere, and ſincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet deems not himſelf to be thereby juſtifyed for the Lord is his judge and justifyer</hi> [whoſe juſtifications are free] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. That if juſtification were in any part by works, then had man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at leaſt, whereof to <hi>glory before God; but he hath nothing whereof to glory,</hi> therefore <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 4. 2. That it is <hi>by imputation</hi> wholly, therefore cannot be from any inherent good in our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4. That if flowes wholly from faiths object or correlate, not at all from any vertue of faith as a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inherent in us: much leſſe therefore from any other qualification or work of ours whatſoever. To which I might add their many other reaſons proving that works cannot juſtifie. That it is by promiſe (as I ſaid) which is ſtill oppoſed to works: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 22. even by that promiſe that was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was free, abſolute, and without all condition of works, that Goſpel promiſe, <hi>In thee all Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed?</hi> A promiſe admitting only <hi>them that are of faith to bleſſedneſſe,</hi> but rejecting them that <hi>are of works to the curſe, Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. Yea by the ſame abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall promiſe or covenant oft renewed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31,-34. &amp; 32. 40. That <hi>this promiſe is made Yea and Amen,</hi> ratifyed and effectuallized in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 20. Not in works, no nor in faith as the Papiſts work, or Arminians act and deed, or otherwiſe then as it is (as <hi>Luther</hi> deſcribes it Allegorically)<note place="margin">Luth. in Gal. Ca. 2. v. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>the matter whereof Chriſt is the form, imforming and giving life and vertue to it;</hi> an act apprehending Chriſt as its object in whom all its vertue lyeth; the cloud or darkneſſe in which Chriſt dwelleth, as God was formerly in a cloud or darkneſſe upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> and in the Temple: or as all our Divines ſay, the hand by which <hi>we receive Chriſt made of God righteouſneſſe</hi> to us and in us, <hi>Gal. 3. 27. 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21. That the life of juſtification conſiſteth not in works at all, nor in faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a ſenſe divided from Chriſt, but in Chriſt our life living in us; ſo that <hi>the life which we live is by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> by the recumbency of our ſouls by faith upon the Son of God which is our life, and that this is to live by faith, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Col. 3. 4. Gal.</hi> 3. 11. That Chriſt with all his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to remiſſion and ſalvation, is given us freely of God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:167891:226"/> (not ſold as by <hi>Judas</hi> to his enemies) and ſo made ours without <hi>money without, price,</hi> without fine, or rent. In the Covenant of grace there is nothing ſmelling of a Simoniacall contract, it is wholly of Gods giving, not in the leaſt particle of our purchaſing, <hi>Iſa. 9. 6. Joh. 3. 16. Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. That the life and juſtification which are by the ſecond Adam, deſcend to us in the ſame manner with the ſin and condemnation from the firſt Adam. But theſe deſcended by our naturall union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the firſt Adam, not by our imitation of him. <hi>For death reigned from Adam, over them that had not ſinned, after the ſimilitude of Adam:</hi> Therefore alſo righteouſneſſe and juſtification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to us by the union and communion which we have with the ſecond Adam Chriſt Jeſus, and not from our imitation of him and configuration to him; <hi>for when we were yet enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Not but that every one to whom the ſin and condemnation of <hi>Adam</hi> once deſcended, are thenceforth imitators of and configured to <hi>Adam:</hi> or that they to whomſoever the righteouſneſſe and juſtification of Chriſt have deſcended, do not thenceforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come imitators of and are configured to the image of Chriſt; but that theſe imitations and configurations do follow and not goe before ſuch union and communion, declaring not producing the ſin and condemnation which are from <hi>Adam,</hi> or the righteouſneſſe and juſtification which are from the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. 19. And this is a ſound Argument which the Apoſtle bringeth to prove that works can in no reſpect juſtifie or ſave: <hi>For we are Gods workmanſhip</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works, which God hath ordained before that we ſhould walk in them, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 9, 10. where we may take notice that good works are Gods end in ſaving or juſtifying us from ſin. But the means do alway in order of nature go before and not follow the end, (in execution I mean, though not in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.) That we are firſt in Chriſt the juſtifyer and in poſſeſſion of the juſtification that is by him, and then being new created in Chriſt to the image of God are inabled to do good works. That God hath ordained before that we ſhould walk in them being ſaved or juſtifyed, not that we ſhould be ſaved or juſtifyed by them. That <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God</hi> [by which we are juſtifyed] <hi>is from faith to faith,</hi> not begun by faith and ended in works, which according to the Apoſtle is a <hi>beginning in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:167891:226"/> ſpirit,</hi> and a ſeeking to be <hi>perfected by the fleſh, Rom. 1. 17. Gal.</hi> 3. 3. Should I proceed ſo far as the Scriptures as a leading thread would guide me for the confirmation of juſtification without works, I ſhould be taken as exorbitant. For the reſt I ſhall refer the reader to ſuch writers as have handled the point of juſtification againſt the Papiſts; or to the diſputations of the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the falſe Apoſtles who taught the ſame doctrine with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> though not expreſly in the ſame words.

                        <p>If we take together with his words that which in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter we have manifeſted to be his meaning in theſe words, and that by the <hi>bare act of beleeving,</hi> he underſtands faith without and in oppoſition to works (for himſelf know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it is his Pontificall-Arminian-Socinian, not our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Evangelicall doctrine which holds out juſtification by beleeving as either a <hi>bare</hi> or a <hi>cloathed act</hi> or <hi>work</hi>) then he teacheth the ſame doctrine for which the Apoſtle anathematized the falſe Apoſtles and arch-church-troublers in his time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. &amp; 5. 12. And what the Apoſtle hath againſt them is againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> their own ſon (I will not ſay in the faith, but) in perverting the faith and Goſpell. For neither did they deny faith, but Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> bare faith, faith without works to be effectuall to juſtification.</p>
                        <p>Againſt this aſſertion common to him and them, if there were no other Scriptures contradicting, but what I have alleaged, no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought by our Divines to ſubvert it, and to eſtabliſh the contrary doctrine, but what have been here expreſſed and implied; (al which are ſcarce a drop of their ful bucket) yet doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> declare any fingleneſſe of heart, or ſincere aime to advance the glory and truth of God, in ſuppreſſing all this and all the reſt in ſilence, ſo to beguile his more Logicall then Theologicall readers (whom he knowes to be more acquainted with Sophiſtry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:167891:227"/> then Divinity, with exotick ſcriblings then Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) with an opinion that the ſtream of Scriptures runne all to his Mill, and that we have nothing from the Word favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our cauſe?</p>
                        <p>Neither let any object that our Churches do only deny the merit of works, not the neceſſity of them as a condition to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Herein I ſhall have a fit place to ſpeak afterward as to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and as it is his plea to lenifie his ſelf-arrogating aſſertion. In the interim to manifeſt the ſimplicity of our gudgeons that are apt to ſwallow the moſt portentous errours if offered to them involved in fine terms of logicall notions, among whom ſome that erewhile did proſecute with bel, book and candle, ſome to death, ſome to baniſhment, ſome to ſequeſtrations whom they thought but to ſmell a little of the perfumes of the purple whore; Theſe very ſame men now having inriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſpoyles of them whom by their outcries they erewhile purſued, are mad to drench themſelves with the very dregs of the cup of fornication which is in the hand of the whore, and kiſſe the lips of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> which hath bleſſed with plauſible words the doctrine which before they deteſted as curſed; and withall to ſhew how degenerate theſe are from our antient worthies, who as Champions of Chriſt have defended this article of juſtification againſt the whole rabble of Antichriſt; I ſhall declare how little difference they were wont to put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen merits and conditions, that though they held ſomewhat to differ in the ſound, yet held them to be one in ſubſtance, and ſtill concluded againſt the Papiſts that there is no place for works in the office of juſtification, either as merits or conditions thereof; but that when the Scripture ſaith we are juſtifyed without works, all works both of Law and Goſpell, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being any way ſubſervient to juſtification, either to the beginning or finiſhing thereof, either as meriting it or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioning us for it. I ſhall mention only ſome few (leſt I ſhould ſeem to attribute much to the authority of men) yet ſo that theſe few ſpeak out the mind and deliver the common judgement of all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, I ſhall produce that famous <hi>Martyrologiſt</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> what he ſpeaketh to this purpoſe in that book of his <hi>De Chriſto gratis juſtificante.</hi> Having alleaged that teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 4. 16. It is of faith that it might be of grace, to the end that the promiſe

Thus he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth works in all reſpects either of cauſality or conditionality from juſtification. Again, <hi>Duo ſunt promiſſionum genera, plurimum inter</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Idem ibid. p. 221.</note>

                        <p>Unto him I annex Dr. <hi>Fulk,</hi> in that Sermon of his which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tranſlated out of Engliſh into Latine, and annexed to the end of that Tractate of his own before-mentioned. <hi>Iſaac not Iſmael</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had the inheritance: Quia nimirum unica ad hanc</hi>

But the inheritance is grounded upon promiſe only, and the promiſe is accompliſhed without any paction [or condition of works] by the ſole mercy of God. And a little after, <hi>Certiſſimos ſe haeredes ſciant ii, qui ad Iſaaci exemplum ita ſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,</hi>

And in the next page he affirmes the promiſe or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpell to be <hi>gratuitam omnibus nulliſque impeditam</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Id. p. 23.</note>

                        <p>In the third place I annex Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> that great light ſhining from the hand of Chriſt upon all the reformed Churches. <hi>Inde juſtificare dicitur fides</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod oblatam in Evangelio juſtitiam recipit &amp; amplectitur; Quod autem per Evangelium dicitur offerri, eo excluditur omnis operum conſideratio, i. e.</hi> Faith is hence ſaid to juſtifie becauſe it receiveth and embraceth the righteouſneſſe offered in the Goſpell. But in that it is ſaid to be offered in the Goſpell, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all conſideration of works is excluded: and ſo works in all conſiderations either of cauſality or conditionality totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. And having proved this from the difference which the Apoſtle putteth between the Law and the Goſpell, <hi>Rom. 10. 3, &amp; deinceps,</hi> he addeth, <hi>Videſne ut legis &amp; Evangelii diſcrimen hoc faciat,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Calv. Juſt. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 11. §. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>quod illa operibus juſtitiam tribuat, hoc citra operum ſubſidium gratuitam largiatur? i. e.</hi> Ye ſee what difference he maketh between the Law and the Goſpell, that the Law attributeth righteouſneſſe to works, the Goſpell gives it free without the aſſiſtance of works. An excellent place (ſaith he) and that which will extricate us from many difficulties, if we underſtand, <hi>cam quae datur nobis per Evangelium juſtitiam legis conditionibus ſolutam eſſe, i. e.</hi> that the righteouſneſſe which is given us by the Goſpell is cleared from the conditions of the Law. And then ſpeaking of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Apoſtle maketh between the Law and the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. It cannot be denyed (ſaith he) that the Law hath alſo its Promiſes, and therefore there muſt be ſomething in the Promiſes of the Goſpell diſtinct from thoſe of the Law, elſe could there be no ſuch oppoſition; and concludes that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is this, <hi>that the Goſpell promiſes are free, ac ſola Dei miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia ſuffultae, quum legis promiſſiones ab operum conditione pendeant, i. e.</hi> and leaning upon the ſole mercy of God, when the promiſes of the Law depend upon the condition of works.</p>

                        <p>Likewiſe in the next Section from that of <hi>Gal. 3. 2.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe works are required to the righteouſneſſe of the one, <hi>ergo ſequitur ad hujus juſtitiam non requiri,</hi> it follows therefore that they are not required to the righteouſneſſe of the other; and further in the ſame place, Herein the Goſpell differs from the Law, <hi>quod operibus non alligat juſtitiam, ſed in ſola dei miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia collocat,</hi> that it binds not righteouſneſſe to works, but placeth it in the ſole mercy of God. And, <hi>Fides ſine operum admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculo &amp;c. Faith without any proppage of works resteth wholly upon mercy.</hi> And that wherewith he concludes this Section; That the righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtifyed is not uſhered into our poſſeſſion by works, <hi>nec operando nos eam conſequi, ſed vacuos accedere ut eam recipiamus, i. e.</hi> not that we attain it by working, but come with our hands empty of all works to be filled with it.</p>
                        <p>With thoſe agreeth <hi>Ph. Melanchthon, Evangelium offert remiſſionem per imputationem justitiae &amp; vitam aeternam ſine conditione legis aut operum noſtrorum, i. e.</hi> the Goſpell offers remiſſion by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of righteouſneſſe, and eternall life without condition of the Law or our works. Again, <hi>Vulgo imaginantur homines Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium eſſe promiſſionem conditionalem: at ab hac imaginatione abdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſunt, i. e.</hi> Men muſt be drawn off from that vulgar ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that the Goſpell is a conditionall promiſe.</p>
                        <p>And upon <hi>Rom. 4. Credens eſt ſalvus ſola fide ſine operibus; Neque nostra obedientia aut cauſa eſt aut conditio propter quam accepti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus coram Deo, i. e.</hi> He that beleeveth is ſaved by faith only, without works; Neither is our obedience either a cauſe or a condition for which we are accepted before God.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Zanchius</hi> in <hi>Hoſ. 2. 21. Notandum eſt hanc eſſe ſimplicem &amp; Evangelicam ſine omni conditione promiſſionem: Hic nihil exigit Deus ſed ſimpliciter promittit quod velit ipſe,</hi> &amp;c. This is a ſimple and Evangelicall promiſe [which is] without all condition; where
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:167891:229"/> God requireth nothing but ſimply promiſeth what he pleaſeth.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Luther</hi> it is ſuperfluous to cite him being every where ſo full both in the poſiting and confirming of this doctrine; let but his Sermon upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. be read; he ſhall be there found calling it <hi>devilliſh doctrine, and the teachers thereof Hypocrites, who teach ſalvation to be far off</hi> (and not already attained) and to be ſought for by works: conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Quicunque ſalutem non ex mera gratia per fidem ante omnia opera,</hi> &amp;c. whoſoever receives not ſalvation out of meer grace, by faith, <hi>before all works,</hi> he ſhall never be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>I had a purpoſe to have annexed the Teſtimonies of ſome more of the Chieftains againſt Antichriſt, but there is no need. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for his part is not a <hi>Zizca,</hi> warreth not by other mens eyes, ſeeth and knoweth againſt whom he levelleth, is not ignorant that all, eſpecially the more antient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſticated worthies of all the Churches, ſpeak the ſame things and in the ſame tone with theſe againſt the Papiſts. Neither was it my purpoſe to deal at all in this paſſage with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> but to ſhew the vanity of ſome Phariſaicall, Cabaliſticall, Sophiſticall, but little Scripturall and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Rabbies, who with Anti-evangelicall ſpirits, (partly to ſet up again a Babell or Babylon of works, as a mount againſt Antinomianiſm, as they term the liberty and purity of the Goſpell; and partly in a proſtrate devotion wherewith they ſacrifice to every Barbariſm and Aphoriſm of exotick arts, to which they muſt ſubmit though it be to the denying of the whole word of God, for fear they ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned Scholars:) are ready to gallop after Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Sophiſticall Lectures into the very Lateran of <hi>Rome,</hi> not knowing whence they run nor whither, whoſe company they leave, and whoſe they follow; ſuch levity and giddineſſe hath taken their head-pieces; that as having gotten a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Proteſtant Divine to lead them into the worſt ſink of Popery, they run with head and ſhoulders, thronging who ſhall be foremoſt: ſo no doubt, if under the profeſſion or miſpriſion of a Jeſuite <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſhould deſcend to preach again and maintain the Doctrine of the Goſpell in all its
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:167891:229"/> verity, power and purity, (and not in a dialecticall phraſe) they would throw it back in his face, as Jeſuiticall and devilliſh. For without ſuch lightneſſe and emptineſſe it were impoſſible for them to be ſo ſuddenly and eaſily whirled into an applauſe of an aſſertion ſo groſly and palpably Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Damning, by a peeviſh veneration of the learning and holineſſe of the Penman thereof. As if among the Jewiſh Scribes and Phariſees, and Popiſh Monkes and Jeſuits, there were not to be found in depth of Learning, and ſtrictneſſe of Legall righteouſneſſe many to whom this man may poſſibly ſerve, and but ſerve as a ſhaddow.</p>
                        <p>But it ſufficeth here to have manifeſted that the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is totally the ſame (in this particular) with the doctrine of the Jeſuits. Or if in any reſpect we ſhall find it in what remains to be examined, not wholly the ſame; I doubt not but in every ſuch difference which we ſhall meet with, to demonſtrate that it is far worſe then theirs. Or if it be not ſo, let him produce any one knowing man within any of the Proteſtant Churches (except he will make the Conciſion of Socinians and Arminians the true Proteſtants) that hath ever taught or held this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The firſt Argument for Juſtification by Works, drawn from Scriptures examined. The Scriptures [cited] prepared to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> hand by the Papiſts; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants anſwer to all the Arguments drawn from thoſe Scriptures by the Papiſts, by him concealed; and the abhorrency of thoſe Scriptures from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which they are brought to prove, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving in part ſupplyed what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have buryed here in ſilence, ſome of the Scriptures and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Scriptures which are brought by the Proteſtants to remove works from having concurrence with faith in the buſineſſe of juſtifying; let us now examine the Scriptures which he quoteth to prove their cooperation with faith to juſtifie. Here (as I ſaid) we meet not with words but figures; partly therefore becauſe he maintains the ſame aſſertion with the Papiſts, partly becauſe the Scriptures which he quoteth are all ſuch as the Papiſts have urged before him againſt us, ſo that he hath taken them up at the ſecond hand, as they were collected to his hand by the Fryers and Jeſuits, himſelf not expreſſing how he would argue from thoſe Scriptures; I conceive it is his deſire that we ſhould underſtand he means ſo to argue as his Maſters have done before him. My labour therefore here will be the leſſe, becauſe the labour of ſo many before me hath been ſo full to manifeſt how alien and improper theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to deſend what theſe men would have defended by them. For why ſhould I ſay again what ſo many worthies have ſaid, untill Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall make it his taske to prove ſome infirmity and inſufficiency in that which they have ſpoken?</p>
                        <p>All that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here ſaith he doth almoſt wholely tranſcribe out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> giving us a compendium of what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath at large, and ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:167891:230"/> is but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> abridged. Let us lay them together, and 1 They jumpe in one common concluſion,</p>
                        <q>That the bare act of beleeving, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> faith alone, ſaith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Theſ. 60.</note> is not the only condition of Juſtification; but many other duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>One of theſe duties according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> firſt, and after<note place="margin">Explicat. p. 234.</note> him according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here, is Repentance. In this alone they differ that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> puts Repentance as the firſt, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> puts it as the fourth in order after Faith, and concurring with it in the pardon of ſin, and ſalvation. The Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alleageth for repentance are ſome from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> ſome from <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fellowes.</p>
                        <p>To this place I referred thoſe Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quoted, <hi>Theſ. 14. pa.</hi> 90. beginning with <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 15. to prove repentance a collaterall with faith. All which are here quoted over again ſaving theſe three, <hi>Act. 20. 21. Revel.</hi> 2. 5. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 16. all which three Scriptures ſpeak no leſſe home to his purpoſe, then if he ſhould thus argue: <hi>Kederminſter</hi> is in <hi>Worceſterſhire, ergo,</hi> it ſupports <hi>Pauls</hi> Church at <hi>London. Act.</hi> 20. 21. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving affirmed himſelf to have dealt faithfully in preaching all that was profitable to them, to evince it, gathers into two heads the ſum of all his doctrine which he had teſtifyed among them, <hi>viz. Repentance toward God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> what is there in this to prove repentance a concomitant with faith to juſtifie? is every profitable doctrine effectuall to juſtifie? A mans food and garments are both profitable to him, ſhall I therefore concude either that his garments do nouriſh him, or his meat clothe him? <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 5, Chriſt admoniſheth the Angell of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, To repent and do his firſt works, elſe will he come and remove his candleſtick out of its place, except he repent:</hi> what is this to juſtification? will he ſay that the removing of the candleſtick out of its place, was either the juſtifying of the unjuſtifyed, or unjuſtifying of him that was before juſtifyed? And <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 16. Chriſt cals upon the Angell of the Church at <hi>Pergamos, Repent, or elſe I will come to thee quickly, and will fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them [viz.</hi> the <hi>Balaamites</hi> and <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> mentioned in the two former verſes] <hi>with the ſword of my mouth.</hi> Surely Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt flie from the latter and rationall meaning, and follow
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:167891:231"/> the precepts of <hi>Origen</hi> in fiſhing after the Spirit, or an Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe of theſe words, to make them ſpeak any thing for his juſtification by repentance. All the reſt Scriptures quoted in the 14. <hi>Theſis,</hi> we have again in a bunch here <hi>pa.</hi> 235. in the explication of his 60. <hi>Theſis</hi> to prove the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>And here why doth he deal worſe then <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting juſtification which he makes to conſiſt in pardon and ſalvation, to repentance, without manifeſting, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, what he means by repentance? This is but to ſtrive about words and leave the matter in darkneſſe. As for the other particular Scriptures here quoted, if I ſhould particularly examine them, we ſhould find not a few of them (as the three former) coming no neerer to the queſtion in hand then Tybris doth to Thames. As for all ſuch of them as have the leaſt ſhew or ſound of ſpeaking for him, he hath them in part from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> whom he here followeth, and in part from other Jeſuits and Fryers that controverſally handle the Popiſh juſtification againſt us. I refer therefore the reader to informe himſelf from the many anſwers of the many Proteſtant Theologiſts which they have extant againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the reſt of that generation; from whom, if truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be dear to him, it is almoſt unpoſſible but that he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Yet ſomething ſhall I ſpeak in generall of theſe quoted Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. As many of them as do hold forth the promiſe of life upon condition of repentance to ſinners, or to ſinners if they repent (all the reſt quotations being altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the purpoſe:) [Theſe all] ſpeak of a legall or of an Evangelicall repentance. Of a legall repentance conſiſting meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a feeling of, humiliation and contrition for, hatred againſt, departing from ſinne; and applying of the endeavours to all morall vertue and obedience. This is a meerly morall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance derivable from the ſtrength of naturall conſcience illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Law and common knowledge of Gods will and nature. In this ſenſe is the word taken in moſt of the Scriptures quoted from the old Teſtament, and ſome alſo poſſibly of thoſe that are quoted out of the new. But then the life by theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures promiſed is not the life of juſtification, or of ſpirituall and ſupernaturall bleſſedneſſe: but that which the adminiſtration under the Law is wont to call life, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <p>This is clear to him that will ſee, from the 18 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> where ſo often mention is made of life and death, Turn and live, if ye turn not ye ſhall die: what is here meant by this life and death, may be underſtood from that proverb curſedly uſed by the Jews whereof mention is made in the beginning of the Chapter; <hi>The fathers have eaten ſowre grapes and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge:</hi> the fathers have ſinned, and death is inflicted upon the children for their fathers fault. This gave occaſion for the delivery of all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine comprehended within this Chapter, in which God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicateth his juſtice from inflicting death upon the children, righteous children, for their wicked parents offences; ſhewing how juſtly they dyed which dyed, and lived which lived, in reference to their own not their fathers ſinne and righteouſneſſe: what then was this death here denounced, or the ſetting of the teeth on edge, but the plague, famine, ſword, which had been upon them in the Land, and their captivity and exile now upon them in Babylon out of the Land of their inheritance? theſe temporall evills are the death here affirmed to be inflicted, and denounced to be continued upon them. The life promiſed upon condition of their repentance, and turning from their evill wayes, was their reſtauration to the land, and bleſſings of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> again. The ſame is evident from the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> having in the name of God, pronounced the many bleſſings and whole confluence of ſecular happineſſe to the obedient, and to them that after much tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and many curſes for their tranſgreſſions ſhould repent and turn; and denounced curſes upon curſes, a whole deluge of judgements, and temporary afflictions one on the neck of another againſt as many as ſhould diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That theſe were the apples and the rods to allure and terrifie them yet in their minority and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167891:232"/> under a paedagogie, untill faith ſhould come and the Sun of tighteouſneſſe ſhine in its ſplendor, that they might walk by faith, and not by feeling, act from love, and not from fear, from the Spirit of adoption, and not of bondage: ſo that this ſhadie life promiſed to a legall repentance, is nothing to the life of juſtification, but ſo far beneath it, that it is in no capacity to be uſed as a proofe about it. Theſe therefore ſerve not at all to drive on Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, Thoſe Scriptures which he quotes that offer life upon condition of Evangelicall repentance doe not make for him any more then the former. For Goſpell repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is taken either in a large or ſtrict ſenſe, in the more large ſenſe it is the ſame with converſion or regeneration, and oft times equipollent and the ſame thing with faith, (though ſome little conſider it to be ſo.) And this is as oft as repentance is put for the one and whole thing required on our part to put us into the actuall and ſenſible poſſeſſion of the grace and life of the Goſpell, as <hi>Mat. 3. 2. Mark. 6. 12. Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi> The ſumme of their preaching was <hi>Repent,</hi> ſo <hi>Luk. 13. 3, 5. Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> &amp; 24. 47. and many other of the Scriptures which he quoteth. In all theſe places repentance containeth primarily the change of our relation, and but ſecondarily of our qualifications and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is a <hi>quidam motus,</hi> in which <hi>acti agimus,</hi> being moved by Gods Spirit we move; the <hi>terminus a quo</hi> in this motion is ſelf, our ſelf-righteouſneſſe and ſelf-confidences, from which we turn no leſſe then from our polluted ſelf, ſinfull ſelf, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes. The <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> is God, the grace of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting us. The <hi>medinm per quod</hi> is the Lord Chriſt through whom we have acceſſe to the Father for remiſſion firſt; and then for ſanctification alſo. And as the ſcope of the Goſpell requires us to underſtand in ſuch Scriptures repentance in this ſenſe, ſo neither do the two Greek words, rendered in Latine <hi>Reſipiſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ntia,</hi> in Engliſh Repentance, refuſe this ſenſe. For what is that change of the mind, of the judgement, wiſdome and will, when it is taken for a Theologicall vertue, but a change of theſe in reference to happineſſe? A renouncing of and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from natures groaping and erring directions, by our own works and righteouſneſſe to ſeek for bleſſedneſſe; and a cleaving
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:167891:232"/> to the directions of the Goſpell pointing out Chriſt as the alone way to it? For inſtance, <hi>Paul</hi> while yet impenitent and unconverted, walked by the light of his naturall conſcience, as it was informed and awaked by the Law, and by this rule walked as a ſtrict Phariſee; <hi>touching the righteouſneſſe which is in the Law blameleſſe, Phil.</hi> 3. 5, 6. and looking (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth) upon the doctrine of free grace, and righteouſneſſe freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, as upon a licentious doctrine, was carried with full ſails of zeal totally to deſtroy it: <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ought to do many things againſt the Name of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which thing I alſo did,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9, 10. Now when the Lord Chriſt met him in the midſt of his raging madneſſe, ſo working upon his heart that he now beleeved in Chriſt whom he had erewhile perſecuted, received him and reſted on him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whom he had erewhile blaſphemed: What will ye call this obedience to the faith, this cloſing of his heart with Chriſt in ſtead of further daſhing againſt him? was it not his converſion, his repentance? or is the promiſe of life (I mean the life of juſtification) made to any other repentance beſides this? In this ſenſe therefore repentance is not a <hi>quid diſtinctum,</hi> a thing diſtinct from, but one and the ſame with juſtifying faith; or if it be objected that it is ſomewhat larger then juſtifying faith: I ſhall not contend but acknowledge that it comprehends whole faith, both <hi>qua juſtificat, &amp; qua ſanctificat,</hi> to juſtification and to ſanctification. Yet this hinders not but that theſe two phraſes, repentance to life or remiſſion of ſins, and faith to life and the remiſſion of ſins, are in the language of the holy Ghoſt one and the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Where repentance is taken in a ſtricter ſenſe, and ſome of the Scripture, which he quotes ſeem to promiſe remiſſion of ſins or life to it; we muſt neceſſarily underſtand of every ſuch Scriptures that it ſpeaketh of the repentance which is actuated in our firſt converſion and calling, or after it. That which is in our firſt converſion or calling, when it is taken in a ſtrict ſenſe, is not as in the former ſenſe put as the whole thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our parts, but ſeems in words a coordinate with faith to intereſt us in the righteouſneſſe and life which are by Chriſt. Such are theſe Scriptures, <hi>Repent and beleeve the Goſpell: repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Mark. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>. 15. Act.</hi> 20. 21. and many other. But in theſe, repentance and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:167891:233"/> faith together make up no more then in other Scriptures, either faith alone or repentance alone in their large ſenſe import: and ſo repentance is taken for ſelf-denyall, ſelf-abhorring, ſelf-ſubduing, and faith for embracing Chriſt: both theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or faith in their larger ſenſe. To no other end doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance caſt and empty out ſelf but to be filled with Chriſt, nor doth faith receive Chriſt untill ſelf be let out and evacuated that it may receive him. See we it in <hi>Paul, his caſting away his</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Phi. 3. 8, 9.</note> 
                           <hi>own righteoſneſſe as dung and loſſe, and putting on of Chriſt,</hi> to win and wear him for righteouſneſſe, were two concurrent acts either of one faith or one repentance, (for we may uſe after the holy Ghoſt, either term indifferently) and repentance here is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from faith, nor faith from repentance, and in naming theſe two the holy Ghoſt nameth not two gifts of grace, but two acts of the ſame gift of grace in us; ſo that hitherto the Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quotes to prove that repentance as a really diſtinct thing from faith juſtifyeth, do wholly fail him. For (as our Divines well ſay againſt the Papiſts) though theſe two acts muſt needs cooperate together, <hi>viz.</hi> the caſting out of ſelf and the receiving of Chriſt; yet it is the latter alone that doth properly and inſtrumentally juſtifie by receiving the juſtifyer and his righteouſneſſe; the former act doth but <hi>diſponere materiam</hi> (as one ſaith not too catachreſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally) doth but put a man as it were in a juſtifiable poſture and capacity, doth but <hi>obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Laſtly, thoſe of the forequoted Scriptures which ſpeak of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in a ſtrict ſenſe advantagious to life after converſion, and that which the Papiſts and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> call <hi>the firſt juſtification,</hi> (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. and ſome other) [theſe] ſpeak of repentance indeed really diſtinct from faith, being an effect or fruit of faith. But this repentance is in no other ſenſe called repentance to life, then as by it the Saints ſometimes recover the ſenſe and comfort of their juſtification, that had for a while laid fainting in them; or as it is impowred from above to repair, confirme and increaſe the life of ſanctification in them. And this is beſides the queſtion in hand, [whether repentance juſtifyeth.] I ſhall therefore pretermit to ſpeak futher of it. And thus have we one file of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:167891:233"/> his Scripture quotations examined, and do finde that all which he would thence deduce to confirme a collaterall officiating of repentance [as a thing really diſtinct from faith] together with faith to juſtification; ſtands him in no ſtead at all.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond duty which he nameth as an equall condition with faith, of our juſtification, <hi>is praying for pardon, and forgiving</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 230.</note> 
                           <hi>others.</hi> In this though he follow <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> yet he holds not himſelf to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words, but having overtaken him, runs beyond him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus ſpeaketh, having mentioned before two things that juſtifie, Thirdly, (ſaith he) <hi>Spes obtinendae veniae, eſt etiam diſpoſitio ad justitiam et remiſſionem peccatorum, i. e.</hi> Hope of forgiveneſſe is alſo a diſpoſition to righteouſneſſe and the remiſſion of ſins. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> outruns him and ſaith, that praying for pardon, and forgiving of others too, are conditions of pardon; but ſuppoſe that I do hope and pray for pardon, and forgive others too, ſhall I then be forgiven? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not promiſe that, but if I do that, (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) then forſooth I may hope well: but what is this <hi>ſenſus compoſitus,</hi> or <hi>caeteris paribus? viz.</hi> if I do this and all that elſe is to be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which either Law or Goſpell commands me. But I demand, if all this be done, am I then juſtifyed? Neither will he grant me this: I am then conditionally juſtifyed, as I was before I did any thing; yea more, I am now a probationer for juſtification, and upon my <hi>bene ſe geſſerit,</hi> my good behaviour, I am juſtifyed for an hour poſſibly untill I be unjuſtifyed again: but if I do all and never ceaſe to do all either while I am living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or when I am dead; there may be poſſibly a day, (when there be no more days) when I may (if all things faie well) be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. But further that all may faie well, will he tell me what the <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the reſt conditions are, that I may perform them all and not miſſe in number? Thus far poſſibly he will condeſcend, to make known ſome of them, and to give me ſome generalls of the reſt, and make known the <hi>materia prima</hi> in which the ſubſtantiall formes lurk, yea the <hi>genera</hi> and the <hi>ſpecies</hi> that are ſuch <hi>ſubalternatim,</hi> but the <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſimas &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimas</hi> together with their individuals, he either will not or cannot particularize the ſeed of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this kind is more numerous then the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> more then the ſtarres of heaven, then the ſands of the ſea for multitude; yet if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:167891:234"/> one be wanting, I am as far from juſtification as if I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: So bleſſed a man will Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> conditions make me. But let me on the contrary part demand of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Suppoſe a perſon truely in the Covenant of grace, vitally in Chriſt, if he have never a one of theſe additory conditions actually moving in him, is not his juſtification and glory as certain as anothers that hath all the conditions? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dares not deny the ſuppoſition to be poſſible; for then ſhall he exclude all dying Infants from the kingdome of heaven, which in another book of his it is ſaid he flatly denyeth) the conſequent therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, that juſtification before God is as ſure without as with theſe conditions; and ſo no condition at all to be granted of our juſtification, ſave that which may aſſure and declare it to our ſelves. What mis-ſpent time will it be then to bawl about two or three of many decads and centuries, yea myriads of conditions, by diſputing whether they be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when if we know not and have not all the reſt it ſhall go as well with thoſe that have none of them, as with them that have all to one? I had almoſt ſaid, when theſe all brought as conditions (in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe) to Gods tribunall will without doubt condition him that brings them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his diſciples may be angry if we hear not what ſo great a Maſter ſaith, for our own ſafety we will attend to hear what Scriptures he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth.</p>
                        <p>The firſt he brings from the prayer of <hi>Solomon, 1 King. 8. 30, 39. Hear</hi> (Lord) <hi>thy ſervants when they ſhall pray towards or in this place, and forgive them, and give to every man according to his wayes.</hi> What will hence follow? either, <hi>ergo</hi> whoſoever prayeth in or towards <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be forgiven, ſo far as forgiveneſſe conſiſteth in giving to every man according to his ways; or ſhall be forgiven <hi>as to the famine and peſtilence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. mentioned, ſo as he pray <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> though he be never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given as to hell fire: or, <hi>ergo</hi> there was a time when prayer for pardon was a condition of forgiveneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Temple ſtood at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if prayer were made in it or towards it; but now ſince the deſolation of the Temple this condition for the ſpace of 1600. years, hath been out of force. Let him conclude better for himſelf from theſe premiſes if he can;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:167891:234"/> I can conclude no better thence to the maintenance of his aſſertion. And it is worthy of conſideration to take notice how extremely the Apoſtles logick and Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> logick do differ. From the like promiſe of ſalvation made in Scriptures to them that pray for it, the Apoſtle concludes that we are juſtifyed and ſaved by faith; thus, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13, 14.</note> 
                           <hi>be ſaved. How then ſhall they call upon him in whom they have not beleeved?</hi> His argumentation runs thus, Whoſoever do [rightly] call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved: but beleevers only call [rightly] upon the name of the Lord: <hi>ergo,</hi> beleevers only ſhall be ſaved. He argues here from the effect to the cauſe, from acceptable prayer, to faith from whence it floweth; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that ſalvation is promiſed to prayer, not as it is an act performed in its ſelf, but as it is a fruit of faith, aſcribing all the furtherance unto ſalvation by prayer, to faith that breaths it out, and all the efficacy which faith hath to ſalvation, to the Lord [<hi>i. e.</hi> the grace of God, or Chriſt the Mediatour] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in. So making faith to be that which, in the vertue of its object, ſaveth; and not prayer either in its act, or in reſpect of the ſpirituall diſpoſition of the heart to pray.</p>
                        <p>And with the Apoſtles argument from prayer to faith, I might alſo argue to manifeſt that the Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quoteth to prove that forgiving of others is a collaterall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with faith to juſtification or forgiveneſſe, have no force in them to prove ſuch a concluſion. <hi>viz. Mat. 6. 12, 14, 15. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts as we forgive our debtours, for if we forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly father will alſo forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly father forgive your treſpaſſes. Mat. 18. 35. So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly father do to you alſo, if ye from your hearts forgive not every man to his brother their treſpaſſes.</hi> The like alſo in <hi>Mar. 11. 25, 26. When ye ſtand praying forgive,</hi> &amp;c. as in the former Scriptures <hi>Luke 6. 35. Forgive and ye ſhall be forgiven. Iſa. 5. 15. And the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and if he hath committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him. Joh. 14. 13, 14. Whatſoever ye ſhall aske in my Name I will do it,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 15. Whatſoever we aske, we know that we have the petitions that we deſired of him.</hi> The reſt have nothing of ſound, much leſſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the purpoſe for which they are quoted.</p>
                        <p>How much theſe Scriptures together with thoſe of the former
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:167891:235"/> bunch that were intended by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for the foyſting in of Repentance, and of the next bundle that he would have to force in all the works of love and obedience into the office of juſtification, may prevail with ſome ſimple and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I know not. For theſe not being able to compare Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with Scripture, and ſpirituall things with ſpirituall, nor to ſearch into the pith and bottom of Scriptures, are <hi>carried</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>with every wind and ſound of doctrine, whither their ſeducers will.</hi> But I do not comprehend what Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> deſigne is, who having compiled this work chiefly, if not only, for the reading of the Learned, ſhould fardle up together theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to deceive ſuch: for the very quotations will ſend them not only to the Scriptures, but alſo to the Commentators upon theſe ſeverall Scriptures, where they muſt needs find him and the Jeſuits ſo wreſting from them the ſame doctrine, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo fully anſwered in their anſwer to the Jeſuites that his Readers will not be able to decide which is the verier Jeſuit, he, or thoſe whom he followeth. I had a thought therefore to tranſmit the Reader to the Commentators.</p>
                        <p>But to manifeſt to the ſimple how little there is in ſubſtance in theſe quoted Scriptures, making for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſhall interpoſe theſe few things.</p>

If then theſe Scriptures ſhould bring in juſtification and remiſſion but in part by our own works and righteouſneſſe, Scripture would here be ſet in commotion againſt Scripture, and God againſt God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth here make this work of forgiving and praying for forgiveneſſe, as alſo in the next place all love, obedience, and the works thereof not ſimply conditions of juſtification and forgiveneſſe, (which in ſome ſenſe far from Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> ſome of our Theologiſts admit) but collaterally and

Will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay ſo of forgiving others, and praying for forgiveneſſe? are all that do it juſtifyed? dares he to ſay it? No otherwiſe, but with his <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> and <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> if he doth this and all things elſe which a Chriſtian ſhould do. And thus I might alſo make every civill and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Action the condition of juſtification.

He hath ſhut up all under guilt, under ſin, that the promiſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be upon all that beleeve, Rom. 3. 19, 22, 23, 24. He juſtifyeth the ungodly, Rom. 4. 5. And ſaveth that which was loſt, Mat.</hi> 18. 11. Are theſe duties to be performed coordinately with faith that we may be juſtifyed? ſurely rather then thoſe which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> nameth, for theſe ſtill go before, but thoſe of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (as far as they relate to it) do follow juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The ſcope of theſe Scriptures is to urge upon all that draw near to God in prayer, to purge out all hatred and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:167891:236"/> of revenge againſt their brethren from their hearts, and the argument by which this duty is preſſed, is, that elſe it (as alſo any other reigning ſin allowed within the heart) will make both their perſons and prayers an abomination to the Lord. God will not hear, will not forgive ſuch as bring, while they bring ſuch a devill in their hearts before him; they ſhall depart without any more anſwer of peace to their ſouls, then they are diſpoſed to give to their brethren againſt whom they are provoked. From theſe Scriptures therefore we may gather how they are qualifyed which are forgiven and juſtifyed, not by what qualifications and works they have obtained juſtification. That whoſoever hath taſted of the pardoning grace of God, the ſame by beholding in Chriſt the <hi>glory of</hi> Gods grace <hi>as in a glaſſe is transformed into the ſame image of grace, love, mercy, goodneſſe, pity,</hi> &amp;c. towards his brethren, as himſelf hath found in God, and ſees ſhining forth upon him from the face of God through Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. That in whomſoever this mercy and goodneſſe of God appears not, whatſoever he boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of faith, and devoutneſſe in prayer, yet it is certain that he is empty of juſtifying faith, and of the juſtification which is by faith: and ſo we have here ſome deſcription of the juſtifyed and unjuſtifyed, not a precept of duties by which the unjuſtifyed may attain to be juſtifyed.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 The three laſt quotations of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> do ſubvert utterly all that he built by the former quotations: For theſe Scriptures affirming it to be not indefinitely prayer, but <hi>the prayer of faith which ſaveth</hi> and obtaineth forgiveneſſe; that not the <hi>asking ſimply,</hi> but the <hi>asking</hi> of the faithfull <hi>in Chriſts Name</hi> is prevalent; that not every one, but <hi>we</hi> know that whatſoever <hi>we aske we have our petitions granted;</hi> do manifeſt that whatſoever vertue is in prayer it floweth from <hi>faith,</hi> prayer it ſelf is a dead work unleſſe <hi>faith</hi> enliven it, and all our works of mercy and forgiving, dead works, untill <hi>faith</hi> becomes the living root from which they derive life, or rather hath breathed out the life which it hath ſuckt from Chriſt our life into them. That it is <hi>Chriſts name</hi> and mediation that makes all accepted with God, and that not to all, but to thoſe peculiar ones of Chriſt that are in union and conjunction with Chriſt, it being a priviledge peculiar to true beleevers that is here mentioned under the word <hi>we,</hi> we have it (ſaith the Apoſtle) the world hath
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:167891:236"/> no part in it. <hi>Eſaus</hi> forgiving, <hi>Sauls</hi> confeſſion of ſin, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his prayer for forgiveneſſe, may (as in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>Act. 8. 22.) perhaps,</hi> be ſo far heard, and forgiveneſſe obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Lord, as to the exempting of them from ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall vengeance, but not to intereſt them in the juſtification of the Goſpell: If the cryes and workes of any of theſe dogs bring them in to partake of the childrens bread, it is but in mans judgement alone; before God it was their faith and cleaving to Chriſt, yea being in Chriſt by faith, that of dogs made them children, and partakers of the Goſpell pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. So theſe Scriptures in no wiſe preſcribe (as I ſaid) the duties by or for which we are, but delineate the Acts and qualifications of thoſe that are juſtifyed by Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>So much in generall to the ſumme of theſe Scriptures; as for the meaning of the ſeverall Scriptures, and how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argues from them as the Papiſts; how the Sophiſters (for ſo our men fitly tearm the Papiſts) endeavour from them to prove juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works, and the Proteſtants anſwer and confute them; I leave to the Reader to fetch from the Commentators themſelves, whom they ſhall finde to ſpeake fully, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knoweth but concealeth, not daring to enter the Liſts with them.</p>
                        <p>The third duty which he brings as coofficiating with<note place="margin">Pag. 236.</note> faith to juſtification, is a complexion of duties, the whole ſwarm, the vaſt mountain of duties, all that men and Angels can deviſe to be duty: yet that he might declare how he can meaſure and contain ſo huge an Ocean in his fiſt, he cruſheth them ſo together as that they may be held in the concave of two Eg-ſhels, <hi>love and ſincere obedience, and their works.</hi> Fain would he have followed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as his ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> follows him here to love, and weary to go after him any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in particulars, ſhakes hands in love with him and parts from him with good leave in reſpect of his method, but in his matter to hold with him throughout the work.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Scripture which he quotes is the firſt which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> alleadgeth; thus,</p>

                        <p>B. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. (though I knew in <hi>Pinks</hi> interpretation of that.)</p>
                        <p>It ſeems <hi>Pink</hi> hath given the right interpretation of that Text which all the Proteſtants give. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> interprets it otherwiſe, and muſt not Chriſt mean as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have him? The words of the Text are theſe, <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſins which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much: But to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth litle.</hi> What doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hence conclude? the ſame with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> her much love was the ground of the forgiveneſſe of her many ſins, and ſo her love went before her juſtification and forgiveneſſe, which followed as the fruit or conſequent thereof. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his fellowrs put authority and holineſſe upon this interpretation, elſe would not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> who makes right reaſon the foundation and rule of his Religion, forſwear his wit and reaſon to follow it. For it is evident from the Text to all that are not ſworn enemies to the truth, that the Lord Jeſus reaſoneth here from the effect to the cauſe, and not from the cauſe to the effect: from the womans great love, that many ſins were forgiven her cauſing this love; not from the greatneſſe of her love as from the cauſe why ſo many ſins were forgiven her. So runs the Text, <hi>Which will love moſt, he to whom the creditor hath forgiven 500. pence, or he</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ve. 41, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>to whom he forgave</hi> 50? The anſwer was, <hi>I ſuppoſe he to whom moſt was forgiven. Thou haſt well ſaid</hi> (ſaith the Lord) ſo it is with this woman, ſhe loves much becauſe much was forgiven her; Who ſees not here the forgiveneſſe to be the cauſe of the love, not the love of the forgiveneſſe? Or will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> which affirmes this woman to be <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> after him, ſay that while ſhe was yet a Harlot and had ſeven Devils in her, that ſhe loved Chriſt much? how good was it to be poſſeſſed of a whole legion of ſuch white Devils that breathed into the ſoul poſſeſſed, ſuch ſtrong love of Chriſt? But why then ſaid Chriſt to her <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, ver.</hi> 50. did her faith only ſave her, but her love juſtifie her? This is one piece of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> new Divinity, and with him I leave it. Let him learn modeſty and truth from <hi>Soarez</hi> himſelf a Prelate among the Papiſts: <hi>Oportet advertere in hoc quod dicitur quoniam dilexit multum: non prius dilexiſse multum, &amp; magnam dilectionem cauſam fuiſſe tantae remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis; ſed vice verſa, quoniam remiſſa ſunt ei peccata multa, ideo dilexiſſe multum: Soarez in locum.</hi>

                        <p>He addes <hi>Mat. 5. 44. Luk. 6. 27, 45. Love your enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That ye may be the children of your heavenly Father,</hi> &amp;c. What will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hence conclude, but that our love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the cauſe or ground of our Adoption? That we love God firſt, and then he us afterward? That not his grace but our righteouſneſſe makes us his Children and him our father? But contrariwiſe Chriſt here exhorteth the children to be like the father; directs his words to the already Adopted, ſo to put on the image and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the nature and operations of their heavenly Father, that they may be, <hi>i. e.</hi> declare themſelves to be the children of the heavenly Father. Like that of <hi>Joh. 13. 35. By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples if ye love,</hi> &amp;c. And that of 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 10. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devill, he that loveth not, is not of God,</hi> &amp;c. So love on our part doth not make but manifeſt us to be the children of God.</p>
                        <p>But remarkeable is his next quotation <hi>Joh. 15. 12, 17. This is my commandement, that ye love one another, ergo</hi> love juſtifyeth; as good as if I ſhould argue, Chriſt commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to angle and take a fiſh: <hi>ergo Peters</hi> angling and catching a fiſh juſtifyed him. As if whatſoever Chriſt commanded, he commanded to juſtification. And as full to his purpoſe is 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9. Eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what the Lord hath laid up for them that love him: ergo,</hi> my love was the condition of Gods laying up for me: as if God had not laid up for me before I loved him. How agrees this with that which after he annexeth, <hi>Mat. 25. Inherit the Kingdome prepared for you before the beginning of the world?</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God;</hi> [who are they?] <hi>ſuch as are called according to his purpoſe,</hi> if called then juſtifyed, and who denyeth the riches of Gods grace diſpenſing all things for the good of his juſtifyed ones that love him? But what is this to loves juſtifying? And rare logick from the next two Scriptures, <hi>Grace be with them that love the Lord Jeſus, Eph. 6. 24. And he that loveth him not, let him be Anathema Maranatha, 1 Cor. 16. 22. Ergo,</hi> love to Chriſt juſtifyeth in rank and life with faith: when I make my love the ground or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods grace, and ceaſe to make the grace of Chriſt the foundation of my love to Chriſt, then will I expect that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will juſtifie me, untill then I ſhall be in his account <hi>Anathema maranatha.</hi>

                        <p>Again, <hi>God hath promiſed the Crown, the Kingdom to them that love him, Jam.</hi> 1. 12. &amp; 2. 5. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Juſtification is a Crown and Kingdom, and love will then juſtifie when it brings us to the Crown and Kingdome, untill then we are unjuſtifyed. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, Joh. 14. 21. Ergo,</hi> our love to Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets love in the Father, and <hi>ergo,</hi> the love of the Father is our juſtification; and what elſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will, for he concludes, <hi>quidlibet e quolibet. I love them that love me, and they that ſeek me early ſhall finde me, Prov. 8. 17. Ergo,</hi> God doth not love us untill we love him, nor ſeek us till we ſeek him, and ſo God is moved by us, not we by him, and perhaps juſtifyed (for of this he ſpeaketh) by us before we are juſtifyed by him. <hi>That I may cauſe them that love me to inherit ſubſtance: and I will fill their treaſures, ver. 21. Ergo;</hi> our juſtification is in our cheſts and purſes, and our love prevails upon God and Chriſt to fill them up to the brim with this golden juſtification.</p>
                        <p>I know not whether I may lawfully follow him in his <hi>non ſequiturs</hi> and playing with the ſacred Oracles of God; ſurely neither <hi>Lucian,</hi> nor <hi>Corn: Agrippa</hi> with his Aſſe, could ever treat of holy things more ludibriouſly, or expoſe the ſacred word of God to more ſcorn then this man doth: were it out of weakneſſe that he doth it, he were to be pittied: But who knoweth not if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knoweth not what validity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity there is in every Argument to prove? Where was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then in quoting ſo many Scriptures which are no more proper to prove that to which they are applyed, then they are to demonſtrate a world in the Moon? he knoweth the moſt of them have neither ſound nor ſhew that way, and thoſe that have ſome ſhew have but a ſhew, and being thoroughly urged to his preſent purpoſe would neither prove what he would have here proved, but contrariwiſe cruſh in pieces ſome of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſertions, which are the pillars of the whole ſtructure made in this book, and falling will neceſſitate the ruine of the whole fabrick. All this he ſaw, therefore ſtopped at the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without alleadging or applying the Scriptures quoted. If the man were no more happy in in his Philoſophy then in his Theology, he ſhould have very little thanks from <hi>Rome.</hi> And it is to be doubted his eſteem will be the leſſe there for his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be a Scripturiſt, and over-turning, or at leaſt ſhaming with his fingering of Scriptures, the ſpecious frontiſpice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:167891:238"/> which he had erected by his Sophiſtry. Unleſſe poſſibly this may advantage him that he ſhewes the ſame genius and ſpirit in arguing from Scriptures, with thoſe holy Fathers and Fryers; for ſo profoundly do we find them arguing, <hi>Thou art Peter and upon this rock,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat. 16.

Such promiſes not being made to all, but to the Saints in Chriſt ſo doing; I ſhall clear it up to you by a ſimilitude. <hi>Iſaac</hi> promiſeth his ſon <hi>Eſau</hi> his bleſſing, but bids him go a hunting and bring him veniſon, and then in eating it, he will bleſſe him: what was that which enrighted <hi>Eſau</hi> to the bleſſing, that was the ground or condition upon which <hi>Iſaac</hi> would bleſſe him? the veniſon caught and dreſſed? nothing leſſe; for if a 1000. others ſhould have preſented him with a 1000. pieces of veniſon at ſeverall times, all dreſſed and fitted to his appetite, the bleſſing ſhould
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167891:239"/> have been reſerved entire for <hi>Eſau,</hi> and they all have been ſent away empty; as appeareth by his dealing with <hi>Jacob</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his made veniſon, how agreeing ſo ever the diſh was to the palate of the old Patriark, yet he will examine thorowly who it is, whether his very ſon <hi>Eſau</hi> that brings it, before he gives the bleſſing: It was not then the veniſon, but the ſonrſhip, yea primo-geniture of <hi>Eſau</hi> that was the ground and condition of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> promiſe to bleſſe him. So is it alſo to his juſtifyed and adopted ones in Chriſt, that the Lord ſaith, Aske and ye ſhall have, ſeek and ye ſhall finde, knock and it ſhall be opened to you, Run and ye ſhall obtain, Overcome and ye ſhall be crowned, Love and I will love you, Be mercifull and I will be mercifull to you, Humble your ſelves and I will lift you up; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more ſuch promiſes of grace, as far as they hold forth ſpirituall and ſaving bleſſings, they are the Childrens bread, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God within his own family; no ſtranger hath part in it, or right to it. Let the world, thoſe that are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, aske, ſeek, knock, run, fight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Lord may poſſibly out of the goodneſſe of his providence, infiniteneſſe of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and bounty of his nature, reward with corporall and temporall good things, their carnall and temporall endeavours, but untill by the ſpirit of adoption they are through faith united to Chriſt, they have no right by the new Covenant to make claim to the ſpirituall and ſaving bleſſings promiſed; neither are they any otherwiſe to be ratifyed to any but as they were beloved of God in Chriſt before there were any ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and motions in them, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cals conditions; as hath been before declared.</p>
                        <p>Yea ſuppoſe that <hi>Eſau</hi> could not have brought the veniſon to his Father, had been hindered or drawn aſide from ſeeking it, or ſeeking could not find it, or finding could not have taken and brought it; ſhould the promiſe and purpoſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to bleſſe him, for this cauſe have failed, He performed not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſhall therefore be bereaved of the bleſſing? Nothing leſſe: for the generall and fundamentall ground and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the relation of a ſon, of the firſt-born ſon, ſtood ſtill fixed; unto which the good will of the Father, and the bleſſing in the Fathers purpoſe was entailed. In like manner, though a child of God fail in ſome of the works and qualifications which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cals conditions of the new Covenant, yet this makes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:167891:239"/> not the promiſe of the Covenant, or the beneficence of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter promiſing, to be void, becauſe theſe are grounded, (ſo far as they are grounded out of God) upon Chriſt, our union unto Chriſt, and new relation to God in Chriſt.

This blaſphemy Chriſt here reproveth and ſmiteth with a weapon fetcht out of their own Armory: Even your own law forbids ſuch evill words and blaſphemies, holding forth Juſtification and Condemnation not only upon condition of good and evill works but words alſo, ſo that there is nothing ſpoken of the juſtification of the New but of the Old Covenant only. A reprehenſion and commination pat to them to whom it was denounced, the threat of the Law to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:167891:240"/> them that refuſed the Goſpell, and were and would be under the Law. But this is nothing to the juſtification of the new Covenant, that followes the rule of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>The next Scripture not contained and examined in the former ſardle of quotations is,</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>B. 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9 If we confeſſe our ſins, God is faithfull to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from our iniquities.</hi> Here confeſſion another work ſeems to be a condition of forgiveneſſe and juſtification.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p n="1">1 If we look ſtrictly to the words, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt hence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue only, that our confeſſion is a condition of Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if God either cannot or will not be faithfull except we confeſſe. But let us give Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> the largeſt advantage that he can claim in the meaning of the words, that God is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and not hypothetically or conditionally faithfull; and that of his faithfulneſſe he will forgive and cleanſe, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. In this ſenſe then whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaketh affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively not negatively, (if we confeſſe he will forgive; not, if we confeſſe not, he will not forgive) I do</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Demand whether confeſſion be ſo a condition of forgiveneſſe that whoſoever confeſſeth ſhall be forgiven. This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not affirme, without his <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> whereof the Text ſpeaks not a word, expreſly or implicitely for him, and if he conclude negatively he concludes not from the Text but his own fancie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> But if you deny forgiveneſſe upon confeſſion made, you deny what the Text affirmeth and ſo fight againſt the word it ſelf, denying what it clearly affirmeth.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, if we deny it to them to whom the Text grants and promiſeth it: But the Apoſtle ſpeaks here not to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifyed and unforgiven, but to the Sants forgiven and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed already, and the Emphaſis of the propoſition or promiſe is in the word <hi>we,</hi> if <hi>we</hi> that are in Chriſt confeſſe, God will hold faithfull in keeping Covenant with us, and forgive. So that this is a conſolation to the Saints againſt all their dayly infirmities. They have a priviledge above all the world beſides, <hi>If they ſin they have an advocate with the Father,</hi> &amp;c. through whom when they confeſſe and bewail their ſins, the grace of God will by his Spirit teſtifie and ſeal to their conſciences the forgiveneſſe of them.</p>

                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:167891:240"/>3 To deſcend without the Text to Mr. <hi>Baxters conditio ſine qua non,</hi> there muſt be more then a grain of ſalt to make his aſſertion ſavory, that without confeſſion there is no forgiveneſſe.

                        <p n="4">4 <hi>I</hi> grant to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that ſome of our Divines have affirmed (though I fear ſomewhat rawly and inconſiderately) that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is a condition <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> of forgiveneſſe, yet far from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe; <hi>viz.</hi> with theſe three limitations whereof Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not endure the teſt.</p>

How and in what ſenſe they will have it a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no place here to treat. It hath been a digreſſion to ſay any thing of it, becauſe it is utterly beſides the Text to which alone here I was to ſpeak.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> Act. 8. 22. Repent of this thy wickedneſſe, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This Scripture I paſſed by in the former heap of his quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as poſſibly a miſtake in the quotation; but finding it here again, and afterward in a third place, I ſee the man means as he quoteth, and cannot enough marvell what he can fiſh from this Scripture to prove any thing of mans works a condition of juſtification. If the word [If] here make or argue a condition, it muſt be on Gods not on mans part, that man muſt repent and pray upon condition that God will forgive, elſe not, if forgiveneſſe be not the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of repentance and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:167891:241"/> prayer. But this is nonſenſe to have God upon terms, if he will have any duty from us. He muſt therefore mean on the other ſide, God will forgive upon condition of prayer and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But how he will perſwade this Scripture to ſay it, is paſt my capacity to comprehend. Here is no promiſe (himſelf grants there is but an half-promiſe) of forgiving on Gods part, [<hi>Append. pag.</hi> 79.] and nothing mentioned as a condition on mans part. But contrariwiſe duties of naturall righteouſneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or counſelled to a naturall man, upon ſuch cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as the Scripture affords to the carnall devotions of carnall men carnally performed; If perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven.

                        <p>Is then Baptiſm a condition ſo neceſſary that without it there is no waſhing away of ſin?

More modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks even <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which makes the deſire of receiving the Sacraments a condition of juſtification, expelling from forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe them that deſire them not; this man rigorouſly and cruelly ſhakes into condemnation thoſe that do not, becauſe they have not opportunity to receive them though their deſire be unfeigned: or if he doth not ſo, this Scripture proves not Baptiſm to be the condition <hi>ſine qua non.</hi> As for calling upon the name of the Lord, I have before ſpoken to.</p>

We deny not the duty of ſtriving in holy things, yea of ſtriving for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; though in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe we deny it. Yet the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Text as appears by its dependence upon the verſe precedent, is, If the corruptions and unbelief of heart be ſo great in the very Saints and beleevers, that they muſt paſſe through the purifying fire of Gods judgments more and more to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them before they be made veſſels of honour in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory; or that they need the ſcourge of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to whip them back to Chriſt, that they periſh not by following their own thoughts: What then ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the wicked, which are wholly full of corruption and unbeleef, without any ſpark of faith, and whom the Lord hath given up to a ſpirit of ſlumber, like Baſtards without all Chaſtiſements hindering, to roll themſelves into ruine?</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The vanity and ridiculouſneſſe of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſecond and third Arguments diſcovered: The former that, Becauſe faith is the more principall, and works the leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall condition of our Juſtification; and that all other duties are in ſome reſpect or other, reducible to faith, therfore we may be ſaid to be juſtifyed by other works and duties, yet to be juſtifyed by faith alone. The ſecond drawn from a wide and irregular definition of faith that it containeth all works in its belly, therefore whoſoever is juſtifyed by thoſe works, is juſtifyed by faith only.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>A ſecond Argument he drawes from an anticipation of an objection, which he prevents by turning the edge of it againſt the objectors and applying it to the ſtrengthening of his own aſſertion. The objection that he ſees in readineſſe againſt him, is, that this doctrine of juſtification by duties and works, wholly overthroweth that higheſt and moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Goſpel doctrine of juſtification by faith alone. This he denies, and affirmes <hi>Theſ. 62. p.</hi> 238. that although we be juſtifyed by a thouſand duties beſides,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Yet faith may be called the only condition of the New Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> of juſtification.</q>
                        <p>True, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> give the denomination, but the queſtion is not, what things may be called, but what they are. A woe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:167891:242"/> is pronounced to them that call or put light for darkneſſe, and darkneſſe for light, good for evill, and evill for good, &amp;c. I ſhall no further preſſe the unaptneſſe of the phraſe, Mr. <hi>Bavter,</hi> declaring in that which followeth, his meaning to be, that faith may be the only condition notwithſtanding; which he proves thus,</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> 1 Becauſe it is the principall condition, and the other but the leſſe principall. And as the whole countrey hath oft its name from the chief City; ſo may the conditions of this Covenant from faith.</p>
                           <p>2 Becauſe all the reſt are reducible to it; either being preſuppoſed as neceſſary antecedents as means, or contained in it as its parts, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or modifications, or elſe implyed as its immediate products or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſubſervient means or conſequents.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>I ſpeak firſt to the latter of theſe two arguments, becauſe he ſpeaks firſt in the explication to the confirmation of it. It is almoſt as wiſe an argumentation as I knew once uſed by ſome home-bred, courſe-ſpun ſons of a Country farmer, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard that their father upon a day was ſworn Conſtable at the Court, made merry at home, concluding from their fathers Conſtableſhip that they were all Conſtables and muſt rule the Pariſh, becauſe they were his ſons and dwelt in houſe with him: or as that of the Athenian boy that boaſted himſelf to be the ruler of Athens, thus proving it, that he ruled his mother, and his mother ſwayed his father, and his father being Lord Maior that year ſwayed Athens. Yea more of reaſon, at leaſt leſſe of reaſonleſneſſe is there in both theſe arguings, then in that of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> theirs concluded only the ſons to to partake neceſſarily of their fathers office: this man makes all that are in any reſpect of kindred, yea of any relation to faith for ſuch their relation to partake of the office of faith to juſtifie. For ſo he reaſoneth, all the reſt are reducible to faith as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents [going before it] means [to obtain it] or parts, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, or neceſſary adjuncts and modifications, or products [effects] or conſequents. What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe all in regard of their alliance or affinity to faith, juſtifie and bear a part with faith in its office of juſtifying. And yet when theſe juſtifie as much as faith, we muſt underſtand that faith juſtifyeth alone:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:167891:243"/> Becauſe what all theſe allies of faith do, that faith it ſelf may be ſaid to do. This is indeed Logick to prevail with his <hi>Keder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſterians,</hi> or rather ſuch of them as know no difference between Logick and Garlick. It is as if I ſhould diſpute thus, God made choyce of <hi>David</hi> before all and any other of the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be King and to rule over <hi>Iſrael;</hi> therefore all the progenitours of <hi>David</hi> as well <hi>Tamar,</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or thus, The eye only of all the members of the body is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the office of ſeeing, nevertheleſſe the head that holds and gives influence to it, the eye-lids that cover it, the veins that convey nutriment to it, the cheeks, noſe, lips, and teeth that are contiguous to it, the hands and feet that are guided by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe and many more do partake of the office of ſeeing together with the eye, and when all theſe doe ſee as well as the eye, yet the eye doth ſee alone, becauſe all the reſt are reducible in ſome way of alliance to the eye. If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> diſpute be not one and the ſame with this in its grounds, then is all my reaſon gone out of my head into my cap. And at ſuch arguing, <hi>Agelaſtus</hi> that laught only once (when he ſaw his horſe eat Thiſtles) would be tickled into a ſecond laughter.</p>
                        <p>And no more weight is there in his former reaſon, Becauſe faith is the principall condition and the other leſſe principall. And as a whole County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here</p>
                        <p n="1">1 I would demand in what reſpect according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can make faith the more principall, and the reſt qualifications and duties the leſſe principall conditions. Not in reſpect of their nature, for if one be, all are ſpirituall and Divine. Nor in reſpect of priority in time, for if not all yet many of the reſt are of the ſame age and birth with faith. Nor in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:167891:243"/> reſpect of durance, for many of them ſurvive faith as juſtifying. Nor in its inſtrumentality to juſtification, for he denyeth any ſuch thing to be in faith. Nor in office, for in it he confounds all together. Nor in the amplitude of its object, for herein love as in other things requires the preeminency. Nor in order of operation, for he makes many of them Antecedents to faith. Nor in the perfection of its effect, for he affirmes the reſt to perfect what faith hath but begun. In what reſpect then is faith the more principall? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhewes not, becauſe according to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, it is beyond my principles to conceive that he can ſhew. Yet he ſaith it becauſe it ſerves his turn here to ſay it; degrading faith at one place, and enthroning it in another at his pleaſure, for his own ends.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 But if it be the principall condition, &amp;c. what will follow hence for Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> advantage? This he makes to follow, <hi>That as the whole Country hath oft its name from the chief city, ſo may the reſt duties from faith:</hi> why doth he not ſpeak plain? it may be, ſaith he; but is it ſo? where doth the Scripture give this name to faith it ſelf? much leſſe to other duties in faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed? Neither is the queſtion about the name but the offices of all theſe. It is rare that the Country takes its name from the chief City; yet this is not in queſtion, but whether the whole Country partake of the priviledges and charter of the chief City. This may indeed be, where potentates that have the abſolute Lordſhip of both, grant to both the ſame priviledges. Yet then the priviledges and dignities of the chief City are not its alone being common to the whole Country with it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But to the very thing in hand without painting and dawb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; When the Lord hath rejected <hi>Mizpah, Shiloh, Dan, Bethel,</hi> and all other the Cities and Country of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaving <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alone there to vouchſafe his preſence and to be ſought unto; it is then a rejection of God, to ſet up Gods name and worſhip elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaving at, and equalize any other place with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>Metropolis.</hi> Hence is that complaint of God, <hi>Iſrael hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>his maker and buildeth temples.</hi> So when God hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated faith alone and qualifyed it for the receiving of Chriſt to juſtification, having rejected all our own righteouſneſſe and works from being priviledged together with it to this office and worke; it is no leſſe then a forſaking of God and of Chriſt to performe the moſt holy duties or to produce
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:167891:244"/> the moſt Celeſtiall qualifications in the leaſt part to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 All that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dares to conclude hence is, that works and duties may be, not that they are, conditions of juſtification. But how from theſe reaſons he will bring about that theſe all are the conditions, or condition, and yet faith the alone condition, if he had ſo many eyes as <hi>Argus,</hi> to guide him, and ſo many hands as <hi>Briareus</hi> to work with by that guidance, he ſhall be never able to effect.</p>
                        <p>Yet in the explication <hi>pa.</hi> 239. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to charme his overly reader into a deluſion, pretends a proof of this <hi>Theſis</hi> by two ſimilitudes, which I forbear to tranſcribe becauſe they are not worthy of ſo much labour. For</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Similies do illuſtrate not prove. He ſhould firſt have proved, and then illuſtrated.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They are not adequate or fitted to the queſtion, ſpeak only to a part of, and not to the whole <hi>Theſis,</hi> conclude at the beſt only that faith may in ſome caſe imply many other duties, but in no wiſe that when faith is ſaid to juſtifie, other duties are implyed under the word faith as juſtifying together with it; much leſſe that all other duties juſtifie, yet faith alone juſtifyeth. If he would reaſon by them home to his poſition, he muſt reaſon to this Tenour.</p>
                        <p>In the former, ſuppoſe a King or State give to me by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the government of ſuch an eminent City or Caſtle, but with this <hi>proviſo</hi> and upon theſe articles, that I disband the Army by which before I laid ſiege to it, remove from me all my Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, quit my ſelf of all my Souldiers, and ſo enter into the poſſeſſion and government, and all the honour and profits thereof, by my ſelf alone and one Counſellour to ſerve and aſſiſt me in the managing of the ſaid government: If now by vertue of this Commiſſion I enter, not having disbanded the ſaid Army, but carry it in with me, ſome under a pretenſe of guarding my perſon, others as my individuall adherents from whom I cannot be ſeparated, others to retain the Citizens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of due loyalty to me, and the reſt under a pretext of propagating the dominion of that power that hath ſo inveſted me with the government: No man will doubt but I enter as a Traytor, not as a loyall Truſtee to the power which hath deputed me. Who will not laugh at it as a ſophiſticall or rather
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:167891:244"/> ridiculous plea, when he hears me maintaining that I entred with that one Counſeller alone, for all the reſt are implyed in him, ſome as his right, ſome as his left hand, ſome his parents, ſome his children, ſome his friends, ſome his ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo I have but him alone in having ſo many thouſands with him? So the new Covenant gives me Chriſt with juſtification and bleſſedneſſe in him, with this Commiſſion and proviſo, that I disband my own ſtrength and righteouſneſſe, the whole Army of my works by which before I laid ſiege to it, to make all mine by my own winning, and to enter into poſſeſſion with faith alone apprehending all from the hand of free grace. Shall I not be a Traytor if I carry the whole Army of works to take and hold poſſeſſion for me, though I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make never ſo golden a pretext of faith only, to which all theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible.</p>
                        <p>The ſame is the tenour of the redemption of the galley ſlave, if you will not run from the Scripture in ſtead of following it in making compariſons. But unto it I ſhall have a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to ſpeak afterward, when we come to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> great adored Argument of receiving Chriſt as our Lord as well as Saviour; or if there be not occaſion offered there, in the interim the ſlaves future ſervice is not a condition but a conſequent of his preſent redemption.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſee now whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with this paint of that which he cals right Reaſon, do fight againſt God or Man, doth reſiſt the placits of men, or elſe the holy Ghoſt himſelf. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before that all might be tryed by Scriptures. Let us now bring his doctrine to the touch-ſtone. I ſhall not repeat all or any of the Scriptures before alleadged, or that might be further alleadged againſt him. One arrow out of that holy quiver, one Scripture out of the whole body of Goſpell doctrine ſhall ſuffice to ſmite to the heart, to death it ſelf, all that he goeth about here with fine flouriſhes of wit to eſtabliſh. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. thus ſpeaks the holy Ghoſt, <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt: For ye are Gods workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the word Saved is an equipollent here with Juſtifyed, if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:167891:245"/> there ſhould be any that will deny, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will and muſt affirme, unleſſe he will beat in pieces one of the chief pillars of the fabrick erected in this book, and overthrow what he hath built. In this truth he muſt joyn with us, though in other he eſtrange himſelf from us. The ſame Act of God being called juſtifying as it diſchargeth us from the ſtate of our miſery as conſidered to be a ſtate of ſin: and ſaving as it delivereth us from it under the conſideration of it as a ſtate of condemnation and vengeance. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will grant, cannot but grant this. And then there will naturally drop from this Scrtpture theſe following poſitions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the juſtification or ſalvation of the Covenant of grace is by faith.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That it is not of works, but by faith in oppoſition to works.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That the very works which flow from our union to Chriſt, and to which we are new created in Chriſt Jeſus, even thoſe which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calleth the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell, are excluded from bearing any part with faith in our juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That the not juſtification by works doth in no wiſe hinder the beleevers performing of them, for they are created in Chriſt Jeſus, their hearts are new wrought by the Spirit to a holy delight in them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 That God hath not ordained them to juſtifie, but for the new created and juſtifyed in Chriſt to walk in them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 That to teach otherwiſe of works, the very works of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is to depreſſe Gods grace, and to extoll mans boaſting and vain-glory.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Even theſe goſpell works and righteouſneſſe are excluded from having any part in juſtifying not only as collaterals with the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, but alſo as collaterals with faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> from bearing a part either in cauſality or conditionality with faith to juſtifie.</p>
                        <p>I challenge Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and all his Legall and Anti-evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall diſciples here to deny any one of theſe poſitions to ſpring naturally from this Text. And if the the holy Ghoſt here ſpeak all this, then by it all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaketh throughout this whole Tractate for juſtification by works is by the breath of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:167891:245"/> Gods mouth blown to the curſe, as in many things I ſhall by Gods help ſhew afterward.</p>
                        <p>At the preſent what he ſpeaketh of works comprehended in faith to juſtification is here ſhaken off as a Sophiſticall, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall, Antiſcripturall dream, the holy Ghoſt here by the poſiting of faith, in expreſſe words rejecting works, Goſpell works, all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes a part with faith in that which he cals Evangelicall righteouſneſſe, from all and any copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with faith in ſaving or juſtifying; ſo excludes all, as that he denyeth that juſtification by grace can any more ſtand, if the beſt Goſpell works of the beſt Saints are put in any cooperation with faith in the promoting of it.</p>
                        <p>All the reſt that he hath in the explication <hi>pa.</hi> 240. and thence to <hi>pa.</hi> 243. is wholly beſides the queſtion, which is not whether works and duties be reducible to faith, or in what reſpect every particular qualification and duty ſtandeth to it. But whether reduced or not reduced, it doth by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment help with ſaith to juſtify us before God. This we have found to be an uſuall feat of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> where his aſſertions are confident and peremptory, but his proofs of them light and ſhadie, to deviſe in ſuch caſe ſome witty paſſage wherewith to divert the conſiderations of his reader, from the ſhame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his foregoing Arguments. And this moſt probably was his drift and craft here, having given us but words in ſtead of Arguments to prove that works are comprehended and implied in faith, in all ſuch Scriptures as attribute juſtification to faith only; that the emptineſſe and nothingneſſe of his argumentation to make this good may not appear to the reader, he tols him a way to attend to a ſubtle and plauſible diſpute, of the relation that every good endowment and work hath particularly to faith. In which diſcourſe of his we will not examine how many things are true and how many falſe; for if they were all true they are nothing to the thing in queſtion; <hi>viz.</hi> whether in the ſeverall relations that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes them to ſtand to faith, or in any other they help with faith to juſtification, and that ſo, as that when all theſe with faith cojuſtifie, we may be yet ſaid to be juſtifyed by faith alone. When he hath ſpoken all by meer affirming without confirming, he thus indeed at laſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>pa.</hi> 243.</p>
                        <q>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:167891:246"/>
                           <hi>B.</hi> So then when you invite a man to your houſe, it is not neceſſary to bid him come in at the door; or bring his head, or arms, or legs, or cloaths with him (though theſe are neceſſary) becauſe all theſe are neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: Even ſo when we are ſaid to be juſtifyed by faith only; or when it is promiſed that he which beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, all theſe forementioned duties are implyed and included.</q>
                        <p>How ecliptick is falſhood, but ſincerity open and full? No man invites another to his houſe but to ſome end, either to taſte of ſome dainties, or hear ſome good tidings, or ſee ſome excellent work, or for ſome other end. He ſhould have named the end, and we would grant him all; thus, that as much as the door, head, legs, armes, clothes of the invited, do partake with the mouth in the act of taſting, or with the eye in ſeeing, or the ear in hearing: ſo much when we are invited to Chriſt, do other duties and workes partake with faith in receiving him to juſtification.</p>
                        <p>A third argument (if indeed it be not one and the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and differ only in words from the former) he draweth from a wide, wilde, vaſt, confuſed and incircumſcriptive defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, begotten of his own brain, and now firſt as an overgrown monſter born into the world, and baptized by the father of it with the name of juſtifying faith. This definition he giveth, <hi>Theſ. 70. pa.</hi> 279. I put this in the third place, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth ſo, (for he hath many things between the former and this) but becauſe of its cognation, if not identity with the former.</p>
                        <p>No doubt he ſaw the former argument more to ſhame then help his cauſe, therefore in likelihood he brings it here again in another mode and forme, if ſo paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it may relieve him. Thus then runs his definition.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:167891:246"/> his Goſpell, and accept of Chriſt as his onely Lord and Saviour, to bring them to God their chief good, and to preſent them pardoned and juſt before him, and to beſtow upon them a more glorious inheritance, and doe accordingly reſt on him as their Saviour, and ſincerely (though imperfectly) obey him as their Lord, forgiving others, loving his people, bearing what ſufferings are impoſed, diligently uſing his means and ordinances, and confeſſing and bewailing their ſins againſt him, and praying for pardon, and all this ſincerely, and to the end.</q>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The fourth and great Argument of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> examined, and the inference, that becauſe Chriſt as Lord as well as Saviour is the object of justifying faith, as justifying, therefore we are juſtifyed by works as well as by faith, is confuted. And withall proved that Chriſt as our Lord dying for us, and not as Lord and a Lawgiver is the object of faith as justifying. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Reaſons to prove the contrary, anſwered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HIS fourth Argument is drawn from the Object of Faith, and the due qualification of the ſame Object. It runnes thus, as by his diſputes compacted and compared together, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B.</hi> If Chriſt be the object of juſtifying faith, as ſuch, not only in his Prieſtly office, as our Redeemer and Saviour, but alſo in his Kingly office our Lord and Ruler, then other works and duties of obedience are as much required as faith in juſtifying us before God.</p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:167891:249"/>
                           <p>But Chriſt is the object of juſtifying faith as ſuch, not only in his Priestly but alſo in his Kingly office, as our Lord as well as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour; <hi>Ergo,</hi> other works and duties of obedience have ſo much to do injuſtifying as faith. [He ſaith affiance, which whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </q>
                        <p>The Aſſumption he layes down and goes about to prove <hi>Theſ.</hi> 66. and in its explication beginning <hi>pa.</hi> 255. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the propoſition he hath and endeavours to confirme in and under <hi>Theſ.</hi> 72, 73.</p>
                        <p>This one of all his Arguments hath the Dominicall letter on it; it is the <hi>wood,</hi> the reſt are but the <hi>hay and ſtabble</hi> of his building; his <hi>ſacra anchora,</hi> if this hold not, the man with his veſſell, and all the traſh-treaſure therein muſt periſh upon the Rocks. All the reſt of his Arguments are but bubbles in compariſon of this bottle-glaſſe. Therefore he attributes much to this, gloryeth in it, and only doth not fall down and worſhip it. It was hinted before here and there in all his diſcourſe, but here he manageth it with all his ſtrength and art.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall ſpeak firſt to the Aſſumption, becauſe he firſt puts and endeavours to prove it. And here now appears what his end was in laying a third opinion of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to juſtification, beſides the active and paſſive righteouſneſs: <hi>viz.</hi> a righteouſneſſe meritorious for us, and not imputed to us; after he had been 10. years for the paſſive righteouſneſſe only, as he notifies to us, <hi>pa.</hi> 54, 55. The ground it ſeems of altering his judgment is, becauſe that opinion would not ſubſerve to his juſtification by works; which he hath ſo pertinaciouſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſet up, that whatſoever of ſacred or humane Authority he meets with oppoſit to it he ſhoulders it out of the way; and whatſoever occurres out of any ſink and puddle making for it, he takes up as a treaſure. But the Meritoriouſneſſe of Chriſts Legiſlative and Kingly office to ſatisfie for our ſins, being laid as a groundwork, he thought (it ſeems) would tend much to the exalting of the works done by the Commandement of King Jeſus, to juſtification: therefore he took it up from <hi>Grotius,</hi> and made uſe of it as a paved way to Juſtification by works, which here almoſt from the ſame grounds he urgeth. And ſo we ſee that from the very beginning to the end of this Tractate, all that he hath, conſpireth and aſpireth to this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:167891:249"/> end [juſtification by works,] and to elude all that the Goſpell hath againſt it.</p>
                        <p>But let us come to examine his Aſſumption to this Argument and what he brings for it.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Theſ. 66. Chriſt is not in any one part or work of his office alone, the object of juſtifying faith, as ſuch; but Chriſt in his entire office conſidered, is this object. <hi>viz.</hi> as he is Redeemer, Lord, and Saviour.</q>
                        <p>In a good ſenſe we might grant him both all this and all the ſubſtance of all the Arguments which he brings to prove it. For none of the Proteſtant Churches have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denyed, but maintain,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That all the offices of Chriſt are needfull and cooperating to, and in the worke of Mediatourſhip; that Chriſt not only as our high Prieſt, but alſo as our King and Prophet made ſatisfaction for us, and makes his ſatisfaction effectuall to us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the object of juſtifying faith is Chriſt in all his offices King, Prieſt, and Prophet.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That theſe offices of Chriſt are not to be ſevered by us, becauſe counited and coworking in him. He layes not down, nor puts from him any one of his offices when he either juſtifyeth, ſanctifieth or illuminateth, &amp;c. but doth all and every of them, as Lord, Saviour and Teacher.</p>
                        <p>Yet when all this is granted to him, his cauſe is never the ſtronger, nor ours at all the weaker. Nay he declares himſelf guilty of the fault wherewith he chargeth the innocent, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſeparating Chriſts offices, holding him forth to us as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming us only as our high Prieſt, governing and giving Lawes to his Church only by his Kingly office, enlightening us in the truth only as our Prophet: when contrariwiſe we teach that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Anointed</hi> of God, in all his offices, and anointings, is made unto us of God wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption; not wiſdome in one only of his offices, righteouſneſſe in another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all in all, as the Scripture witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Nevertheleſſe we deny not but ſome acts and benefits of Chriſt are to be attributed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and peculiarly to one then another office of Chriſt, yet ſo that the cooperation of the other offices therein is nor wholly to be denyed.</p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:167891:250"/>
                        <p>But this we deny, that there is <hi>any other fountain opened for the waſhing away of our ſins but the bloud of Chriſt only;</hi> or <hi>any other ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to the juſtice of God but by the ſacrifice of Chriſt alone;</hi> yet ſo as this bloud and ſacrifice as they are primarily our high Prieſts, ſo are they our Kings and Prophets alſo, howbeit the bloud and ſacrifice of one Chriſt alone. And herein we follow the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures leading threed which affirm not only the Prieſt to have dyed for us, but our Prophet or Shepheard alſo: <hi>I am the good Shepheard, and give and lay down my life for the ſheep, Joh. 10 11, 15.

                              </gap>. The Lords body, and the Lords bloud, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 29. And need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was it that Chriſt as Lord and King with all his power ſhould thus grapple with ſin, death and hell, on our behalfe; how elſe ſhould he have vanquiſhed them, and <hi>having ſpoyled theſe Principalities and powers, made a ſhew of them openly, and triumphed over them? Col.</hi> 2. 15. And without this victory his death had been to us vain, our enemies had remained unconquered, and our ſelves unranſomed. <hi>The ſtrong man had not been driven out by a ſtronger then he, Luk.</hi> 11. 21, 22. Thus we neither divide nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the offices of Chriſt one from another, but conjoyn them all in the death and paſſion of Chriſt, by which alone we beleeve and teach that the Lord, Prieſt and Prophet, Chriſt Jeſus hath made ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
                        <p>But we utterly deny that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> drives at, that Chriſt as our Lord, that is, as a Lawgiver, and [to ſpeak in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words, <hi>Theſ. 31.] as he doth eſtabliſh the morall Law commanding perfect obedience, and forbidding every ſin, as exactly as under the Covenant of works;</hi> is the object of juſtifying faith, as juſtifying. This was that great and principall article which <hi>Luther</hi> with ſo much vehemency defended againſt the Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is<note place="margin">Luth. in Gal. Cap. 2. 20: &amp; alibi.</note> no <hi>Moſes, no Exactor, no giver of Lawes</hi> [in reference to juſtification] <hi>but a giver of grace, a Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. pronouncing it an <hi>accurſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:167891:250"/> helliſh</hi> doctrine which the <hi>Papiſts taught, that he juſtifyeth as a Law-giver, that they which ſo paint him out, make him not a Chriſt but a Fiend or Devill.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſtate of the queſtion then is betwixt him and us, not whether Chriſt as Lord as well as Saviour; but whether by the ſacrifice of himſelf for us, or elſe by giving Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all duties of obedience to us alſo; be the object of juſtifying faith, as juſtifying, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether our faith by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt in the works of righteouſneſſe as well as by cleaving to Chriſt crucifyed do juſtifie? We maintain that the death of Chriſt, or Chriſt dying for us, is alone offered to our faith for juſtification: he contrariwiſe, that Chriſt as commanding the duties of obedience is the object of faith as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
                        <p>Our Aſſertion that Chriſt ſuffering for us is the alone object of juſtifying faith, as ſuch; may be confirmed by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>One Argument may be drawn from the offerings and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the old Teſtament, and the ſacraments both of the old and new Teſtament. Such as theſe have exhibited, or do ſtill exhibit Chriſt to us for redemption or juſtification, ſuch is our faith ſtill to receive him. But theſe all have exhibited and do exhibit Chriſt, not as a Law-giver, but as an offering or ſacrifice for our ſins: therefore under this notion our faith is to receive him to juſtification. So all the ſacrifices, circumciſion, paſchal Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the old Teſtament, directed the faith of men to Chriſts ſacrifice to the bloud and wounds of Chriſt for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if any will ſay (as he may truly ſay) that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion typified alſo the renovation of the heart by the Spirit of Chriſt, himſelf may anſwer himſelf that this was to ſanctification, and not to juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The whole ſtream of the Goſpell leads our faith to Chriſt crucifyed or dying for juſtification. <hi>As the ſerpent was lifted up in the wilderneſſe, ſo ſhall the Son of man be lifted up, [viz.</hi> upon the croſſe] <hi>that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, John 3. 14, 15. I determined to know (i. e.</hi> to preach among you for your knowledg) <hi>nothing elſe but Christ, and him crucifyed, 1 Cor. 2. 2. If I be lifted up I will draw all men to me,</hi> (ſignifying what death he ſhould die.) <hi>Joh. 12. 32, 33. He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh. 6. 47, - 58. Whom God hath ſet forth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:167891:251"/> as a propitiation through faith in his bloud, Rom. 4. 25. Being justified by his bloud, Rom. 5. 9. The bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, 1 Joh. 1. 7. The Lambe of God</hi> [ſacrificed] <hi>that taketh away the ſins of the World, Joh. 1. 29. Having made peace through the bloud of his Croſſe. Col. 1. 20. And reconciled us in the body of his fleſh through death, Ver. 21, 22. Having redemption through his bloud even the ſorgiveneſſe of ſin, Col 1. 14. He hath purchaſed his Church with his bloud, Act. 20. 28. Having boldneſſe to enter into the Holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus, by the new and living way, which he hath conſecrated through the veil of his fleſh, Heb. 10. 19, 20. He was wounded for our ſins and bruiſed for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and by his ſtripes we are healed, Iſa. 53. 5. God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing but in the Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6. 14. I might even weary the Reader with allegations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures every way as pertinently and properly making Chriſt dying for us the object of faith as juſtifying. And I challenge Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and all his admirers, to produce one Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt as a Law-giver to be the object of our faith to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If they cannot do it, let it be acknowledged as an auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and daring preſumption in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> from his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without and againſt the Word, to lay it down here as a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and principle of Religion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 If the death and ſufferings alone of Chriſt (and not his giving of Lawes and commanding duties of righteouſneſſe) be the ſole and entire ſatisfaction which he hath given to the juſtice of God for us, then Chriſt in his death, and not at all in his Laws and Commands of ſuch duties, is to be made the object of our faith for juſtification. But the former is true: therefore the latter alſo.</p>
                        <p>Both the conſequent and conſequence of the Propoſition muſt needs be granted by all Proteſtants (though not by Remonſtrants and Socinians) which hold the imputation of the obedience of Chriſt to us by which he hath ſatisfyed Gods juſtice; that he for us and we in and by him have done our law: that his ſatisfying obedience is by imputation ſo fully made ours to juſtification as if we had done it our ſelves; which is the doctrine of all Proteſtant Churches. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hateth this phraſe of imputation of Chriſts obedience, will not, cannot admit it; for then he deſtroyes and pronounceth all at the beſt to be erroneous whatſoever he hath ſpowted out for ſacred doctrine; he grants the imputation of nothing elſe but our own faith and works to juſtification; ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:167891:251"/> that after his principles the conſequence is not ſo clear. Let us ſee therefore whether alſo after and upon his own grounds, it may ſtand firm and undenyable.</p>
                        <p>1 Then, Mr. <hi>Baxter Theſ.</hi> 18. affirmes our Legall righteouſneſſe (as he cals it) <hi>i. e.</hi> that righteouſneſſe by which the Law is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for our breaches of it, to be in Chriſt; and in calling this Legall righteouſneſſe <hi>ours,</hi> and the ſatisfaction therein made <hi>ours,</hi> he doth imply that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is the thing that being made <hi>ours</hi> is that which juſtifyeth us. This he ſpeaks out yet more plainly, <hi>pa.</hi> 218. telling us that Chriſts ſatisfaction muſt be made <hi>ours,</hi> elſe we cannot be juſtifyed: that ſo far as by imputation no more is underſtood then the beſtowing of Chriſts ſatisfaction on us, ſo that we ſhall have the juſtice and benefits thereof as truely as if we had ſatisfyed our ſelves; in this ſenſe he granteth the imputation of Chriſts ſatisfactory righteouſneſſe; and thus according to his principles, that act, or thoſe acts of Chriſt by which he made ſatisfaction for us, or rather Chriſt in theſe acts is to be made the object of our faith as juſtifying. According to this rule <hi>pa.</hi> 54. he makes the Active righteouſneſſe of Chriſt (conſidered as ſuch) part of the ſatisfaction together with the Paſſive: and to lay a ground for that which he here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, <hi>pa.</hi> 57, he affirms that among other parts of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe or Active obedience, <hi>his aſſuming of the humane nature, his eſtabliſhing and ſealing the Covenant, his working miracles, his ſending his Diſciples to convert and ſave the world, his overcoming death and riſing again, &amp;c.</hi> (which were all works moſt proper to his kingly office) to have been meritorious and ſatisfactory. And all this to lay a foundation for what here and <hi>Theſ.</hi> 72. he buildeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt as a Law-giver as well as a Redeemer is the object of juſtifying faith as ſuch, and that obedience to his Laws as well as faith in his ſufferings, hath to do in our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>We finde then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> making Chriſt in his Legiſlative righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe upon this ground alone to be the object of juſtifying faith, as therein he in part ſatisfyed for our diſobedience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>hoc nomine</hi> and in this reſpect muſt the conſequence of the propoſition ſtand firm with him, <hi>viz.</hi> If only the death and ſufferings of Chriſt and not at all his Legiſlative righteouſneſſe, be the ſole and entire ſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then Chriſt in his death onely and not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be made the object of faith as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:167891:252"/> For in that righteouſneſſe alone by which Chriſt ſatisfyed, is faith to apprehend him to juſtification, by his own rules.</p>
                        <p>The Aſſumption then remaines alone needfull to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſts death and ſuffering alone is the entire ſatisfaction. This is clear to them which will not wilfully retain beams in their eyes, from theſe Scriptures which affirm the <hi>life of Chriſt ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for us to be the Ranſom, Mat. 20. 28. 1 Tim. 2. 6. The Price by which we are purchaſed and redeemed from thraldome. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 20. &amp; 7. 23. <hi>The propitiation for our ſins through faith in his bloud. Rom. 3. 25. 1 Joh. 4. 10. i. e.</hi> that one and only act of Chriſt by which our ſinnes are expiated, the juſtice of God ſatisfyed, and his wrath appeaſed, ſo that we finde him now a God propitious and gratious to us.</p>
                        <p>But if we will hear the Scriptures ſpeaking at large and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culately confirming this poſition, that the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt is begun, continued and perfected meerly and wholly in and by Chriſts ſufferings, in ſteed of many Teſtimonies which the Scripture affordeth, I ſhall pitch upon two diſputes only of the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The former in <hi>cap</hi> 9. beginning at the 11 and 12 <hi>verſes.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt being become an high Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by his own bloud entred once into the Holy place, having obtained for us eternall Redemption.</hi> I need not explain the words for the edification of any that hath but read the Scriptures, and taken but overly into his conſideration, how that which was yearly under the Law figured in the act of the high Prieſt the type, was at length effectually accompliſhed by Chriſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.

If the bloud of Buls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſanctifyed to the purifying of the Fleſh, how much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, which by the eternall Spirit offered himſelfe to God, without ſpot, purge your conſcience from dead works?</hi> &amp;c.

Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and in bearing them on our behalfe he ſatisfyed juſtice on our behalf. And this is affirmed to be by offering himſelf for us, not by giving Laws to us, or injoyning duties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                        <p>His ſecond diſpute is <hi>chap.</hi> 10. where the Apoſtle having mentioned the feebleneſſe of the ſacrifices offered by the Law, to take away ſin, brings in Chriſt offering himſelf to accompliſh what theſe could not, and declaring his ready obedience to <hi>fulfill that will of God written in the volume of Gods book to offer himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> with a <hi>Lo, I come: by this will of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, ver.</hi> 5, — 10. He ſaith not, we have our conſecration to be holy, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by the offering of his body. And that by ſanctification is to be here underſtood purification and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; I think it will not be denyed: However <hi>ver.</hi> 12. it is added, that <hi>he having once offered ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſat down at the right hand of God,</hi> his ſitting down and reſting argues his work the work of our redemption and juſtification perfected in every degree and number. His reſt is as Gods reſt was from the beginning, then the work of Creation, now of Redemption being made abſolutely perfect, the reſt followed; and where had this work its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progreſſe and perfection? In his once offering of ſacrifice for ſins for ever. Nothing here of Chriſts Law-giving and rule from the bottom to the top of the work of Redemption or Juſtification. The ſacrifice alone ſatisfyed, ſo far all things of man are here excluded, as that nothing elſe of Chriſt is required. As it is more fully yet expreſſed <hi>ver.</hi> 14. For <hi>by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctifyed.</hi> His perfecting Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not deny to be his making of perfect ſatisfaction for them, and this is done by one offering of Chriſt. Will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be ſo audacious as to oppoſe the holy Ghoſt with his Nay, telling that there muſt be ſomewhat elſe beſides this offering, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Law-giving as part of the ſatisfaction made for us. Laſtly,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:167891:253"/> to put all out of doubt, and beſides the bounds of cavilling, what the Apoſtle ſhould mean here by ſanctifying and perfecting, this alſo is unfolded in plain words, <hi>ver. 17, 18. viz. The taking away of their ſinnes and iniquities: And where the remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more offering,</hi> &amp;c. ſatisfaction is made to the full and no need of any addition for the perfecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledg there are many things required to condition Chriſt that he might be an effectuall offerer and offering, elſe could not the redemption and juſtification which are by him have been completed; or the ſatisfaction made for us been perfect. Yea that after the work of ſatisfaction, as formerly of Creation fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and a totall reſting from any further addition to it, yet the Father worketh and the Son worketh hitherto in the buſineſſe of governing and preſerving of what is ſo created and repayred: yet this doth not at all hinder but that full ſatisfaction is made by the alone offering of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And here once more I call upon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and all his adherents to bring forth any one teſtimony of Scripture, to prove that either Chriſts Law-giving or any other act of Chriſt, beſides this one of offering himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, is by the Scripture in whole or in part affirmed ſatisfactory to God for our juſtification. Let them not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> before doth from <hi>pa.</hi> 54. to <hi>pa.</hi> 61. bring their peradventures, and may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bees, and poſſibles, and veriſimilies, (for are the conjectures and reſults of a working and ſelf-conceited brain, to be laid as a foundation whereon to build an Article of our faith?) But let them bring the oracle of the Word teſtifying either that Chriſt hath done, or God hath required of him or accepted from him ſuch and ſuch works in part of ſatisfaction. Elſe our ears will be deaf to hear mans prattle, being attentive in ſuch matters only to the voice of the holy Ghoſt.</p>

The exalting of his Kingly office is as principall an end of his dying and becoming Mediator, as is the ſaving of us, and exalting of his Prieſtly office; ſee the 2. Pſalme, &amp; Rom. 14. 9. To this end he both dyed, roſe again, and revived that he might be the Lord both of the dead and the living; and therefore the receiving of him as Prieſt alone, is not like to be the condition of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</q>
                        <p>An invincible argument! he that will not be ſwayed by it, let him continue in his wits ſtill. As if whatſoever thing God had an end to exalt by Chriſts death muſt be the object of faith as juſtifying. God intended by it to exalt his elect; are the elect therefore the object of juſtifying faith? Beſides we ſay not that the receiving of Chriſt as Prieſt alone juſtifyeth.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> So that if Chriſt put both into the condition, we must not ſeparate what he hath joyned.</q>

                           <hi>B.</hi> But the main ground of their errour who think otherwiſe, is this, They think acceptance of the mercy offered, doth make it ours imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in a naturall way, as the accepting of a thing from men, and ſo as if he that accepteth pardon ſhould have it, and he that accepteth ſanctity ſhould have it, &amp;c. But Chriſt (as I have ſhewed) eſtabliſheth his office and authority, before he beſtoweth his mercies, and though accepting be the proper condition, yet doth it not confer the title to us as it is an accepting primarily, but as it is the Covenants condition: If we we ſhould take poſſeſſion when we have no title in Law, God would quickly challenge us for our bold uſurpation, and deal with us as with him that intruded without the wedding garment. There is more adoe then come in, and ſit down, and take what we have a minde to: God hath put all his Sons offices into the condition, to be received and ſubmitted to: Either all or none muſt be accepted. And if all be in the condition, then the receiving of all muſt needs juſtifie upon the grounds that I have laid down before.</q>
                        <p>It is not a new thing to ſee hereſie uſurping the chaire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne truth of errour. The reaſoning here is wholly carnall and naturall, beſides the rule of the Goſpell. When he calls faith a <hi>naturall way</hi> of receiving the mercy offered by Chriſt, and our own worth and works (implyedly) the <hi>ſpirituall way,</hi>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:167891:255"/> how doth he put light for darkneſſe, and darkneſſe for light, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the truely ſpirituall, cauſe of renewing that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. The naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. Can Heaven and Hell be more oppoſite either to other then the Apoſtles doctrine to Mr. <hi>Baxters?</hi> The Apoſtle cals the <hi>way of faith alone, the Spirit,</hi> and the way of works ſuperadded to faith for juſtification, <hi>the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 3. 3. Is it Fleſh or Spirit in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that makes him a contradictor of the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the Apoſtle. The way of faith is the way of grace, ſupernaturall, <hi>Fleſh and bloud cannot reveal it unto us, but our Father which is in heaven.</hi> But the way of works is beneath grace, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature it ſelf, therefore naturall, but ſo that all the force of nature cannot effectuallize it to juſtification.</p>
                        <p>It is a ſlander that he puts upon the Orthodox whom he hateth, therefore repreſents them as Noddies, and Simpletons, pretending that they teach faith to be nothing but an accepting of pardon, and accepting of holineſſe, [<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Nay we make neither pardon, nor holineſſe, nor the [<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] but Chriſt Jeſus the object of our faith, adhere and cleave to him for all, yet not confounding his benefits, or the means by which he applyeth them, but wait by faith at the ſeverall ſluces by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his ſeverall benefits, to receive the waſhing away of our guilt by the effuſion of his bloud, and holineſſe or ſanctification by the effuſion of his Spirit and not contrariwiſe holineſſe by his bloud, and pardon by the effuſion of his Spirit. So we repair by faith to Chriſt for all, becauſe in him as in the ſpring is all; yet ſo as that in coming to him alone that hath all, we come to the Sun of righteouſneſſe for light, to the fountain for life, and to the Spirit of ſanctification which flowes from him for holyneſſe. He cryes againſt ſeparation, and makes it (as I have ſhewed) for union, and makes confuſions. Where doth he mention any office or operation of faith to ſanctification? or uſe of ſanctification but to juſtification? or what is faith with him but a compound of all endowments, works, and duties? And thus he confounds faith and works, Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and mans righteouſneſſe, morall honeſty, and Goſpell ſanctification, of all together making up one linſy-woolſy juſtification or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to juſtification, which the Spirit of God never revealed, but the ſpirit of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath hatched.</p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:167891:255"/>
                        <p>What he ſpeaketh of Chriſt ſtabliſhing his office, either is above my underſtanding, or elſe is not at all to his purpoſe. And what of accepting as under the notion of accepting, or as under the notion of a condition, hath been enough ſpoken to in what was before ſaid about the inſtrumentality of faith.</p>
                        <p>All that followeth is wholly averſe from, and adverſe to the doctrine of the Goſpell, Jewiſh and Popiſh. For what meanes he by our title in Law, and the wedding garment, but the whole furniture of works and duties done in obedience to a ſuppoſed legiſlative authority of Chriſt? Without theſe and before theſe to take poſſeſſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> to dare to adhere to Chriſt for juſtification is uſurpation, and an incurring of Gods vengeance for uſurping: Thus beating off from Chriſt ſinners, chief ſinners for whom Chriſt hath dyed. How doth the ſpirit of the rejected Jewes work upon this man? when they heard of righteouſneſſe and<note place="margin">Act. 22. 21, 22, 23.</note> ſalvation offered to the Gentiles, a common and profane people that were not holy, how did they ſtretch their throats, and rend their clothes in a zeal againſt this indignity? So this man hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the juſtificition of Publicans and ſinners, <hi>hath his eye evill becauſe God is good:</hi> tears himſelf with anger, crying, uſurpation, vengeance, hell-fire; why? becauſe they had not put on the <hi>filthy rags of mans righteouſneſſe,</hi> which he cals the <hi>wedding garment,</hi> and thereby gotten title to Chriſt before they were ſo bold as to beleeve in him, and girded on their own gaol-clothes firſt, and then have put on Chriſt upon them, that their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might have been neereſt the heart, and Chriſts righteouſneſſe at a further diſtance, as having no efficacy but from our own righteouſneſſe effectuallizing it. Unto all this I ſhall uſe only that oracle of the Lord Chriſt, <hi>The Publicans and harlots enter into the Kingdome of God before theſe Phariſaicall juſticiaries, and whited ſepulchers.</hi> Let Chriſt alone be my wedding garment, I leave all that unrighteous righteouſneſſe which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would wreſt out from the Kingly office, entire to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his righteouſneſſe to juſtification. I know no other title to the juſtification of the new Covenant, which the chief ſinners muſt look after before they poſſeſſe it, but the grant of grace in the new Covenant, and their cloſure by faith with Chriſt, in whom God preſents himſelf to juſtifie and reconcile them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. One voice of my Bride-groom, crying, <hi>Whoſoever thirſteth, i. e.</hi> is dry and empty of all good in himſelf, <hi>let him come to me,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:167891:256"/> and whoſoever will, let him drink of the well of the water of life freely, Rev.</hi> 22. 17. is of more force with me then ten thouſand contradicting voices ſuch as this of Mr. <hi>Baxter, There is more adoe then come in, and ſit down, and take what we have a mind to:</hi> If this man had the imaginary place of <hi>Peter</hi> to be Porter of heaven, how quickly would he forfeit his place by repelling thoſe whom alone Chriſt will have admitted, and admitting thoſe that Chriſt will have repelled? Chriſt admits beleevers, not doers, this man rejects all beleevers that are not doers before they are beleevers.</p>
                        <p>The reſt that he ſaith here is ſacrificed to his Goddeſſe the Lady Condition. A deity that the Scriptures never knew; nor yet all the whole Univerſity of Athens.

Yet of this Almighty power he proclaimes her that ſhe binds the hands of God and Men: the one cannot give, the other cannot receive without her mediation. Neither the eternall Father, nor the eternall Son can ſhew the leaſt mercy to a poor ſinner, nor the ſinner partake of one crumb of mercy from the Father by the Son, unleſſe this great Lady Condition ſay Amen to it; ſo high and ſo to vaſt a bigneſſe hath the Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſtretched her. Yet is he ſtill adding, and in this place he is nayling in the offices of Chriſt into her bulk. But becauſe this <hi>Coloſſus</hi> is only from his own brain, and nothing of Gods Word brought to own one piece of it, let us leave him admiring if not adoring his fabrick or figment, and refer our ſelves to anſwer when he brings any thing from Gods Word.</p>
                        <p>We have ſeen by this time the invalidity of the Aſſumption of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Argument, and of all the Reaſons which he brings to prove it; either to give proppage to his own aſſertion, or any way to ſhake and weaken ours.</p>

His obſcuration in this, that he names juſtifying without the adjection there uſed [as ſuch] we will underſtand him here meaning what there he ſpeaks, elſe we run from the queſtion. His explication, that here he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds what he meant there by accepting Chriſt for Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> the hearts ſubjection, [to Chriſts Legiſlative power, or his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of woeks and obedience.] In this ſenſe we deny ſtill that the accepting of Chriſt for Lord is an eſſentiall part of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, as ſuch. And all that which he ſeems further to bring for the confirmation thereof, <hi>pa.</hi> 287, &amp; 288. is but the ſaying over again of what he had ſaid before, and a little prattle of Phyſicall and morall Philoſophy, which is as fit to explain to us the myſtery of Chriſt, faith and juſtification; as a net is to hold faſt the winde: and yet if all his reaſoning thence were granted, his cauſe is as naked and weak with it as without it. The reſt is nothing but words, his own words, his bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, wherewith we have been ſo much wearied, that the very thought of them is offenſive. We expect Gods word, let him bring it, or hold his peace.</p>
                        <p>The conſequent of this <hi>Theſis,</hi> which is alſo the conſequent of the propoſition of the Argument which we are here examining; he puts here more fraudulently then I rendered it there, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſincere Obedience doth as much juſtifie as affiance, that, as the fruit of our accepting Chriſt for Lord and Law-giver, as much
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:167891:257"/> as this, which is a fruit of accepting Chriſt for our Saviour. How ſlippery is falſhood, and how full of evaſions? Let him ſpeak poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and plainly, hath ſuch obedience any thing to do in juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us? I ſhould not lie if I ſhould ſay, I have conquered ſo many Armies, taken ſo many Towns in, and brought ſo much gold from the Weſt-Indies, as Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> yet though I ſpeak no lie, I cannot be excuſed from ſpeaking vanity in ſaying it; for neither of us have done it. But let us ſee whether there be more poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his poofs then in his affirmations. In his 288. <hi>pag.</hi> thus he ſpeaketh to it.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> That obedience is as neer a fruit of faith as affiance, is evident; if you take it for the obedience of the ſoul, in acts that are no more remote from the heart then affiance is: and ſo is the obedience of our actions externall, in its formall reſpect (as obedience): though not in its materiall, becauſe the imperate acts are not all ſo neer the fountain as the elicite.</q>
                        <p>If by this profound reaſoning there be any that will not be perſuaded to be a Chriſtian of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> painting, let him continue to be not only almoſt but altogether a Chriſtian of Chriſts making, and he ſhall never ſuſtain damage thereby to his conſcience or ſalvation. The queſtion is not here how neer or how remote a fruit of faith, obedience is, but whether the neereſt or moſt diſtant fruits thereof, conſidered (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth) as our acts or deeds; nor yet whether theſe acts as cloſe to, and remote from the heart, nor whether imperate or elicit acts, but whether ſuch acts are at all appointed of God to juſtification? We deny it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> brings nothing to prove it.</p>
                        <p>Yet not to ſuffer the leſſe exerciſed and informed Reader to depart unſatisfyed, nor to roll up in darkneſſe and ſilence any truth of the Goſpell, proper here to be cleared; I ſhall manifeſt in what reſpect Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> aſſertion may be here warily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Chriſt as Saviour, and ſatisfier, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the ſacrifice of his death, hath made a way for ſinners to God, yea made himſelf the way, and is in reſpect thereof made to us of God, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This he did principally (not only) as our high Prieſt, the other offices were not excluded. This was not the whole work that he was ſent to do. He muſt bring into the way alſo that he hath made, all that are to be ſaved in it and by it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 16. And having brought them he muſt alſo enable them to bring
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:167891:257"/> forth fruit to God by being their ſanctifier, <hi>Joh. 15. 5. Rom.</hi> 7. 4. 6. in theſe works he acteth principally as our Prophet and King. To bring us into communion with him, and into that way which he hath made through himſelf to righteouſneſſe and bleſſedneſſe, as our Prophet he teacheth, and as our King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, but as Prieſt, Prophet and King effectuallizeth his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commands by his Spirit: In this reſpect his commands to us of coming by faith into union with him, of adhering to him, and repoſing our ſelves wholly upon him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and life, we grant that Chriſt as our King commanding, as far as we look to the thing commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> faith in his bloud alone for juſtification, is an eminent inſtrument of our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as he effectuallizeth the merits of his death to us may not be unproperly made the object of our faith as juſtifying. But in his other forementioned operations upon us by his Word and Spirit, not only to teach and command, but alſo by his infinite power to enliven us to bring forth fruits of ſo great a ſalvation, and to walke worthy of it in all holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and exactneſſe to fulfill all duties and works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian obedience; In this he is to be made indeed the object of juſtifying faith, or (which is the ſame) of ſanctifying faith, yet not at it juſtifyeth, but as it ſanctifyeth. We ſhould not a little maim both the office of faith, and the benefits which we have by Chriſt, if we ſhould reſtrain them all to juſtification. Nay Chriſt is made unto us as well ſanctification as righteouſneſſe; and faith adhereth as faſt to Chriſt for the one as the other: elſe is it not a legitimate but baſtard faith. Nevertheleſſe Chriſt is not in the ſame reſpect the object of faith as ſanctifying, and of the ſame as juſtifying.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe this is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſupereminent Argument, in which himſelf ſeems moſt to truſt, and by which ſo many learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do even profeſſe themſelves ſtaggered and aſtoniſhed: I ſhall omit nothing unexamined that he ſpeaketh in the affirming or confirming of it, leſt any ſhould take occaſion to ſay that the ſtrongeſt part thereof is not, becauſe it could not be, anſwered. Therefore have I left out nothing of what he hath ſaid to the other Propoſition; though many things were unworthy of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion. To the conſequent of this Propoſition, he ſpeaketh more in his next two <hi>Theſes, viz.</hi> 73. &amp; 74. what is inſerted in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:167891:258"/> theſe two Aphoriſms, more fit to be examined under another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſhall here forbear to tranſcribe, leaving it for its proper place. What is to the preſent purpoſe, he thus expreſſeth,</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>

                              <label>Theſ. 74.</label> Both faith and works juſtifie in the ſame kind of cauſality, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Cauſae ſine quibus non,</hi> or mediate and improper cauſes; or (as Dr. <hi>Twiſſe) cauſae diſpoſitivae,</hi> &amp;c. The like may be ſaid of Love, and of others in the ſame ſtation.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Theſe are but meer affirmations, and contain no reaſons to confirme, only in the latter <hi>Theſis,</hi> ſeemingly at leaſt, is produced the authority of that Antinomian Dr. <hi>Twiſſe:</hi> but with ſo fine a conveyance as that he may be kept in or left out at pleaſure if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be dealt with to make good his allegation of him. He knowes the name and authority of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> to be great and amiable, as an eminent ſervant of Chriſt, and patron of his truth. He concludes therefore that his aſſertions will be ſwallowed with the more facility having ſuch an authority to ſweeten and fortifie them. Therefore ſo interſerteth his Teſtimony, that his Reader may ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> to affirm works to be <hi>cauſas diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitivas</hi> of juſtification. I neither have read all that Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> hath written, neither do I ſo far truſt my memory, as to deny it flatly and peremptorily. Yet by knowing Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> aright, I am as confident that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath taught the righteouſneſſe of juſtification to be meerly by imputation, and our juſtification only by faith, as that Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> hath any way affirmed works in this or any other reſpect to prevent or operate to our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If he did, why doth not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quote the place, as elſewhere he doth very diligently when the Teſtimony of the Author makes for him? or why in the end of his Appendix, where he ſucks out of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> and others, all that he thinks may make for his advantage, doth he not cite this ſo pregnant a Teſtimony? But he hath left to himſelf an evaſion, that when he hath beguiled whom he can with ſuch an authority, being found at laſt, he can anſwer his meaning is, the term or phraſe, (viz. <hi>cauſa diſpoſitiva</hi>) upon ſome other, not to this Argument, is that which Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> uſeth. I finde him indeed calling works <hi>cauſas ſine quibus non;</hi> or <hi>diſpoſitivas ſalutis,</hi> of our ſalvation or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, never of our juſtification: And ſo far is he from attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:167891:258"/> under this term what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> attributeth, that he ſeriouſly abandoneth it. So he expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Vind. Lib. 1. Par. 2. Sect. 2. Proxime finem. Vix majus p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> 1. We have before granted to him that he gives no cauſe of ſuſpicion that affection of ſingularity and novelty hath drawn him into this opinion.

                        <p n="2">2. Whether the ſearcher of all hearts witneſſe for him that no good will to Popery in generall provoked him to trouble the Church with his doctrine, I will not judge: But if good will to this part of Popery that conſiſts in juſtification by works, (unto which if all the reſt garbage of Popery be compared, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to counterpoiſe it in miſchief) did not provoke, let him ſhew what hath provoked him to it. Is it in hatred to the Papiſts that he hath laboured ſo ſtoutly to maintain their Kingdome? Is not this the pillar of all Popery? and if this be demoliſhed, what is there of all their hereſies but will fall after?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As to his ſincerity in this buſineſſe in following conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly his judgment; I know, I finde in my ſelf, <hi>the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull above all things and deſperately evill, who can finde it out?</hi> I ſearch only my own not anothers heart, that is out of my orb, and beyond my fathom. But I ſhould give the more credence to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaking of his own ſincerity in this buſineſſe, did I not ſee him forſaking the fountain, and digging to himſelf ciſterns, deriving from every puddle of Papiſts, Arminians, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians and Atheiſts, both his tenents, and all fallacious Sophiſtry to maintain them, leaving the pure word of God, and toſſing it either from him, or for himſelf at his pleaſure.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As for his prayer if preſented to God after his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as an Act helping to juſtifie him, and no further, through the mediation of Chriſt, then as the ſame mediation take effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy (as to him) from his own works and worth; no marvell if the juſtice of God flung it back as dirt in his face, and left him to that de luding ſpirit which worketh by thoſe falſe Apoſtles whom he had ſtudied ſo many years, having ſpent but a few days upon the Scriptures as himſelf confeſſeth. So the Phariſee after his praying departed from the preſence of God, unjuſtifyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. Such devout Proteſtations may poſſibly take impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the weak and ignorant: But Satan in the vizzard of an Angell of light, and Satan in his own ghaſtly viſage, is to them that are ſtrong in the faith, the ſame Satan and alike ſhunned.

                        <p>He promiſeth ſome proofs of what he ſaith, and one argument he puts in this explication, thus,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> If faith juſtifie as it is the fulfilling of the condition of the new Covenant, and obedience be alſo part of the condition; then obedience muſt juſtifie in the ſame way as faith: But both parts of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent are before proved.</q>
                        <p>An Herculean Argument, as ſoon may a man wreſt the Club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> his hand, as make void the concluſion which is inſerred by this Argument. If my eye diſcerneth colours upon condition it look diligently upon them, and my hand doth inrich me upon condition that it ſtretcheth forth it ſelf to receive a Princes beneficence, and my heel be put into the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with my eye and my hand, then my heel doth diſcerne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the ſame way with my eye, and enrich me in the ſame way with my hand: But both parts of the Antecedent are as firmly proved before, as the both parts of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> antecedent. <hi>Ergo</hi> the concluſion is as very a blank as Mr. <hi>Baxters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> oft ſaying of the ſame thing doth prove the thing to be true, then this cannot be denyed to be a truth. For who can number the times that he hath kiſſed and ſpit in the mouth of this Aſhteroth Condition, ſetting it up cheek-mate with Chriſt himſelf in juſtifying us. For <hi>Theſ.</hi> 56. he yoaks together Chriſt and faith in the ſame way of cauſality to juſtification, and here and every where faith and obedience or works, ſo that Chriſt, faith and works are collaterals in juſtifying, how? as they meet together in this one Great Coloſſus condition, or <hi>cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> Chriſt is the condition, (even in his ſatisfaction) and faith is the condition, and works is the condition: ſo that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (it ſeems by him) juſtifyeth more then works, or faith, or Chriſt: for neither works alone, nor faith alone, nor Chriſt, alone doth juſtifie. But this <hi>mouth-almighty Condition, when like Bel and the Dragon,</hi> ſhe hath eaten up and ſwallowed into her bowels, Chriſt, faith, and works; doth of, and by her ſelf alone juſtifie, ſuch a Juſtifyer, and ſuch a Juſtification.

                        <p>Here it is remarkable that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> who followes the Jeſuits every foot and inch in the interpreting of this and all other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures from which he would with them ſet up juſtification by works, like a man made all of zeal, perks up to terrifie us from an interpretation contradictory to the text, and from uſing apparent violence to it; implying that all the Proteſtant Churches and Saints which have ſtood in the defence of the faith of Chriſt againſt the Papiſts, now almoſt 200. years, have dealt thus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly in robbing this Text of its due ſenſe: And the Fryers and Jeſuites alone (good men) have ſtood up as the faſt friends of Chriſt, to maintain this truth of Chriſt, and the ſpirit and meaning of this Scripture, againſt the violation of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious hands of theſe hereticall Proteſtants: And that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is now at laſt ſtirred up by the Spirit that hath wrought ſo powerfully upon the Jeſuits, to vindicate and ſet forth the true meaning of this Text, with the ſame fidelity and ſincerity which they his Maſters have uſed before him. Therefore to excite all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:167891:261"/> men to gaze on his ingenuity and ſincerity, and to admire him as the one alone man among Proteſtants raiſed up to undeceive all the Churches that have ſo long ſtrayed from the holy mother Church, he thus like wiſedome it ſelf uttereth his voice.</p>

But when it is the very ſcope of a Chapter, in plain and frequent expreſſions, no whit diſſonant from any other Scripture; I think he that may ſo wreſt it, as to make it unſay what it ſaith, may as well make him a Creed of his own, let the Scriptuee ſay what it will to the contrary. What is this but with the Papiſts to make the Scripture a noſe of wax?

                        <p>This he goeth about to doe by daſhing in peeces all whatſoever hath been ſayd by all or any of the Proteſtant Churches or Writers againſt the Papiſts in expounding this Text, thus.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> The ordinary expoſitions of St. James are theſe two. 1. That he ſpeaks of Juſtification before men, and not before God. 2. That he ſpeaks of works, as juſtifying our Faith, and not as juſtifying our perſons: (or as Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> phraſe is) The Apoſtle when he ſaith works juſtifie, muſt bee underſtood by a Metonymy, that a working faith juſtifieth. That the former expoſition is falſe may appear thus.</q>
                        <p>This is his ſhewing the clearneſſe of that in St. James, <hi>viz.</hi> to anathematize all that any of the faithfull ſervants and Martyrs of the Lord Jeſus within the Proteſtant Churches have ſpoken in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may bee embraced by all after the Catholick that is Romiſh interpretation.

                        <p>What he therefore fraudulently omits I ſhall heer ſupply, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the expoſitions as our Divines give it and the grounds of it, and not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> corrupts it. We have found him acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that <hi>if it be but ſome one phraſe diſſonant from the ordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture, that one muſt bee reduced to the reſt, and not all the reſt to that one.</hi> pa. 297. So ſtands the caſe heer. The ordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yea drift of the New Teſtament, is to hold forth Juſtification by faith without works (as wee have ſeen before) and every one that will but conſideratively reade as other the Evangeliſts, ſo chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly the Goſpell written by Iohn the Apoſtle, the Acts of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the Epiſtles to the Romans, to the Galatians, to the Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians, and Hebrews, eſpecially and above the reſt, and withall from the reſt it muſt needs appeare. This one paſſage in one Epiſtle hath a ſound of differing &amp; but a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Muſt al be reduced to this or this to all? According to the rule therefore allowed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelfe, our Divines give an interpretation to this one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that may declare it, (though it hath a ſeeming,) yet not to have a reality of diſſent from the reſt. Becauſe if this be Canonicall and from the H. G the H. G. cannot contradict himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>In expounding this diſpute of <hi>James,</hi> therefore the Proteſtants take notice of a two fold homonymy of words, one in the word <hi>Faith,</hi> the other in the word <hi>Juſtifying,</hi> both which Paul and <hi>James</hi> uſe, but uſe them the one in one, and the other in another ſence, ſo that though they ſeeme ſomwhat to differ in words, yet in ſenſe they ſpeake the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They ſay as when Paul ſpeakes of Faith to juſtification, by <hi>Faith</hi> he meanes a true and lively Faith, which fetcheth power from the merits of Chriſt to Iuſtifie, and from the ſpirit of Chriſt to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie: ſo Iames here battereth under the name of Faith, a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and boaſting of Faith, which ſome Hypocrites leaned on to Iuſtifie them, being wholly deſtitute of Faith indeed that is alive, and effectuall to draw from Chriſt matter both to Iuſtification and Sanctification. 2. They ſay that as Paul takes the word <hi>Iuſtifying</hi> for remiſſion and abſolution before God, ſo <hi>James</hi> takes it (as oft as he requires here works to Iuſtifie) for the declaration of the truth of our Faith, and Iuſtification before men.</p>

                        <p>Yet let not this their diſtinction (if it may fitly be ſo termed) and expoſition bee taken up unleſſe it hath ſufficient grounds from the Text to beare it up.

                           <p>But the juſtification in James, is of greater moment as appears in the Text. For 1. It is ſuch as ſalvation dependeth on. ver. 14.</p>

                        <p>To the former all that he ſaith is Sophiſticall and Fallacious.

Againſt all theſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> excepreth, pronouncing that mans judgement herein is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> incompetent, and the evidence inſufficient, therefore to make uſe of any judgement or diſcerning in this kind, is uſurpative. Doth he herein fight againſt men, or againſt God?

Thus have we found one part of his arguing vaine and wide from the ſcope, in going about to prove that <hi>James</hi> his Juſtification by works is not to be taken for the declaring of us to men to be truly juſtified.</p>
                        <p>His ſecond diſpute is to prove that this Juſtification by Works is to be underſtood of our juſtifying by works at Gods Tribunall. His Reaſons to prove it are partly in his words before tranſcribed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a new ſupply thereunto added. The firſt Reaſon in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B. 1.</hi> It is ſuch as Salvation dependeth on. <hi>ver. 14.</hi> Brevis eſſe laboro, Obſcurus fio.</q>
                        <p>No mans immoderate prolixity and tediouſneſs hath ever ſo much troubled mee, as this mans pretended affectation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs and brevity. By it, when hee ſpeakes nothing, he gets the advantage to bee thought of fooles, that he ſpeaketh great and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall things. Were it not that I regard ſuch as are too apt to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his whiſtle though they know not his tune, I ſhould rather kick at ſuch Delphicke myſtericall paſſages of his, than take them up to looke on them. If <hi>James</hi> here take not juſtifying and ſaving for the ſame thing, then (to uſe Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words) I am not certaine what to be certaine off. So that when he ſaith it is ſuch a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſalvation dependeth on, it is one as if hee had ſaid it is ſuch a juſtification as juſtification dependeth on, or ſuch a ſalvation as ſalvation dependeth on. The Apoſtle there ſpeaks of a dead and barren Faith, of a profeſſion not a being of Faith, and by an interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation bearing the force of a ſtrong Negation, by ſaying, Can Faith, [or the ſaying that he hath Faith,] ſave him? he means, and ſaith, it cannot ſave him: and that is the ſame with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he had ſaid, it cannot juſtifie him. Here wee have indeed an idle dreame of Faith that cannot ſave. But a Iuſtification that cannot juſtifie, or cannot ſave, or can juſtifie and not ſave, is as far from <hi>James</hi> as neare to Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>

                           <hi>B. 2.</hi> It is ſuch as followeth only a ſaving faith. But the world may as well juſtifie us when we have no Faith at all.</q>

                        <p>That the juſtification of the New Covenant in which God evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth by faith to us that we are juſtified in Chriſt, or the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which conſiſteth in the evidencing by works to men the truth both of our Faith and Goſpel Juſtification, ſo far that in charity they are to regard us as truly beleeving, and truly juſtified; do both follow either ſaving faith, or that which in charity to them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, men are to account a ſaving faith: none denieth. But it will not hence follow, that works juſtifie us at Gods Judgement ſeat, becauſe they follow faith that declareth and evidenceth us to our ſelves to be ſo juſtified. He comes with a new ſupply pa. 296.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Once more: 1. Was Abrahaem juſtified before men for a ſecret Action? 2. Or ſuch an Action as the killing of his only Son would have been?</q>
                        <p n="1">1. Had the Action been kept ſecret from men, it could not have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified him before God or men. Not before God, for no actions as acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the ground of his juſtifying us (as hath bin already abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved.) Nor before men: for this action could not have declared the truth of his faith to them that never heard of the man or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But God having ordeyned him to bee a Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pattern of all beleevers to the worlds end, and to confer Bleſſedneſs with Abraham, upon all that walk in the ſteps of the Faith of our Father Abraham. Ro. 4. 9. 12. hath recorded this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his, to juſtifie and magnifie the truth of his Faith to all that in all ages ſhall beleeve, and to incite them by his patterne by the like eminent obedience to juſtifie their Faith alſo to others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are not to enquire what the evil world will judge of ſuch an Action, but whether Abraham, or rather the ſpirit of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and by Abraham, did not give in this Action a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to convince the evill world (much more the ſaints cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the world) of the truth of his Faith. Which conviction if the evill world will carnally neglect or curſedly oppoſe, it ſhall leave them the more inexcuſable in the day of Judgement.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Was not he the Juſtifier beer which was the imputer of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? but God was the imputer of Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ver. 23. Therefore God was the Juſtifier. So I leave that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to ſleep.</q>
                        <p>This is one of his extravagancies. He hath all this while diſputed of Juſtification by works: what he cannot prove of works, now he proves of Faith. James ſaith, Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Was it imputed to him of God,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:167891:266"/> for a partiall or for a perfect righteouſneſs? If but unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in part, let him prove it, or ſtand guilty before God for perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his word. If in the whole, then is there no place left for works to challenge a part. Or let him produce from James the like ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of works imputed to Abraham to Righteouſneſs; elſe he puts the handle of his Argument into our hands to retort it upon him. Abrahams Faith was imputed to him [by the teſtimony of Iames] to righteouſneſs; <hi>Ergo</hi> [by the teſtimony of Iames] works were not ſo imputed to him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So</hi> [his Epiphonem] <hi>I leave that interpretation to ſleep,</hi> is the only ſound thing that he hath ſpoken to this queſtion. For he hath ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hath any power to awaken much leſs to rowze it: <hi>So that it may ſleep,</hi> and that ſecurely and in ſafety, becauſe they are but falſe Alarms that he ſoundeth againſt it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond interpretation (as Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> terms it) or as it is indeed the ſecond homonymy or different ſenſe of words, wherin our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines affirm Iames and Paul to ſpeak in ſound one, but in meaning diſagreeing eyther from other, is in the word [Faith] as hath been ſayd. Paul when he attributes juſtification to Faith without works, means a living faith fruitfull in good works. Iames where he denies Faith without works to juſtifie, means a dead faith, a meer profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith that hath neither life nor being, much leſs fruitfulneſs in good works. That Iames takes the word Faith in this ſenſe appears by theſe Reaſons from the Text it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the ſcope of his diſpute which we ſhall find to be (as I ſayd) to beat down the preſumption of carnall profeſſors, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the hope of ſalvation wholly upon a bare profeſſion of faith, though the faith wherof they boaſted had no vertue to ſanctification &amp; obedience; and to prove that alone to be a juſtifying Faith which is alive to good works. This even <hi>Cajetan</hi> himſelf one of the pillars<note place="margin">Cajetan in Jacob.</note> of the Romiſh Church, giveth as the ſcope of the Text, as I have ſhewed; &amp; he further expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>Adverte hic prudens Lector, quod Iacobus non ſentit Fidem ſine operibus mortuum eſſe &amp;c. Quoniam conſtat nos per fidem juſtificari, etiam ſine operibus, ſed ſentit fidem ſine operibus,</hi> i. e. <hi>renuentem operâri, vel non paratam operari eſſe mortuum, eſſe vanam, &amp; non juſtificare.</hi> That is, Let the prudent Reader heer note, that Iames means not that faith is dead without works [to accompany and help it in juſtifying us] for it is evident that faith juſtifieth, even without works: but his meaning is, that faith without works, that is, that refuſeth or is not in a readineſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:167891:267"/> to good works, is dead, vain, and juſtifieth not. Thus he makes the ſcope of James heer to prove that an idle and fruitleſs faith is not a ſaving or juſtifying faith. So that we find it eaſier in this argument to find the truth from the very Papiſts than from Mr. <hi>Br.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the 14. ver. where James putting the queſtion of faith without works, ſaith not indefinitely, can faith, but annexeth the article to it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>can this faith ſave?</hi> Is there power in ſuch a faith to ſave, which hath no power to ſanctifie? In like maner as heere, ver. 20. What in our Tranſlation is rendred faith [abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] is there alſo in the Originall put with the reſtriction of the ſame article [<hi>that</hi>] faith which is without works is dead.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From the attributes that he gives to the faith to which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth juſtification, <hi>viz. a dead faith,</hi> ver. 17. 20. 26. <hi>A faith of Devils,</hi> ver. 19. But a dead and Devilliſh faith are not a true Goſpel faith, but at the beſt a figment and counterfeit thereof.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From the ſimilitude by which he illuſtrateth his diſputation: If a man in a pretence of charity, ſpeaks comfortable words to his hungry and naked brother, Alas poor ſoul be cloathed, be filled, but miniſtreth nothing to him for his refreſhing; will any call that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of words true charity? Is it any more then a paint therof? So alſo of him that ſaith hee hath faith, but evidenceth it not by its fruits &amp;c. The verball faith doth no more profit to juſtification, than the verball charity to ſanctification. If one of theſe in the mind of the Author be true charity, then according to the minde of the Author alſo, the other is true Faith,</p>
                        <p n="5">5. From the object of that Faith which <hi>James</hi> excludeth from Iuſtification, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> acknowledgeth that the object of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is Chriſt, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 66.-68. and their explication. But let him ſhew that <hi>James</hi> doth here expreſly or impliedly, in any one paſſage of his diſpute, make Chriſt the object of that Faith which he excludes from juſtification: or any other object than the Faith of a meer Heathen or Hypocrite may pitch upon, <hi>viz.</hi> generall truths, that <hi>there is a God &amp;c.</hi> elſe let him grant from his owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that it is not true Faith but an unprofitable Hiſtoricall Faith (as ſome terme it) which is here excluded.</p>
                        <p>Thus have our writers in anſwer to the <hi>Papiſts Cavills,</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the minde of <hi>James</hi> in this place, or rather from him ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what himſelfe expreſſeth to be his minde and this they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe (not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> perverts them) by ſome one, but by both of theſe interpretations viz. of the word [juſtifying] and the word
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:167891:267"/>
[Faith] manifeſting out of <hi>James</hi> himſelfe, that as oft as in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute he attributes juſtification to works, he ſpeaks of juſtification <hi>i e.</hi> the declaration or manifeſtation thereof to men. As when verſ. 21 <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ver. 25. <hi>Rahab</hi> and ver. 24. A man indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are ſaid to be juſtified by works, he meanes they are ſo manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and declared by their works to us. This is a uſuall phraſe not only in Scripture, but in our common expreſſions and our common talk. I will juſtifie what I have ſpoken or done; <hi>i. e.</hi> I will declare it, make it appear to be all good, true, and juſt: I will juſtifie him from all that is layd to his charge, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will declare and prove him juſt and free from all that he is charged with. Again where hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth juſtification to that dead faith that worketh not by love: that by faith he means a falſe profeſſion and counterfeit of, and not the true juſtifying faith: and who among us ever ſaid, that to ſay, I have faith, (never expreſſing the power and fruits of it) can juſtifie a man? So there is nothing to be found in James croſſing the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yea Evangelicall and Apoſtolicall concluſion, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied [in our conſciences before God] by faith alone without works, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a living and working, not a dead faith: yet without works can we not be declared and manifeſted juſt unto men.</p>
                        <p>That which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath ſpoken againſt the former part of this interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> juſtification before men, we have found to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs or worſe than nothing. To the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the denying of juſtification to faith that is a counterfeit, a falſe profeſſion of faith, hee ſaith nothing; and why? becauſe hee hath not what to ſay. Therfore he ſtifles it in darknes, will not have his Reader hear of it, for then <hi>actum eſt,</hi> he muſt run to S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or ſome other Saint, S. James leaves him in the mire. It is no leſſe ludicrous than fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he turns the ſtate of the queſtion another way, and danceth round about it, never comming to that which our Divines anſwer. 1. Having deviſed pag. 294. that we ſay James ſpeaks of works as juſtifying our faith, not our perſons, he doth pa. 296. goe about to prove that works juſtifie the perſon, not the faith only. And who ever denied this poſition? Doe not wee all ſay that the holy life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the truth of faith, and therin juſtifieth (as to men) the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of it from all hypocriſie in making ſuch a profeſſion? 2. pag. 297. he falls foul with the Ghoſt of ſweet Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> for ſaying that by Faith and works <hi>Iames</hi> underſtands a working Faith. And after a ſharp chiding, without examining his Reaſons (the matter whereof I have before examined) at length p. 298. fetching breath,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:167891:268"/> he offers him peace and friendſhip, upon condition that he will ariſe from the grave &amp; ſay what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith. But deſpairing of that, and concluding, if he ſhould riſe again from the dead, he would ſtill ſay with the Proteſtant Churches and Writers, that <hi>Fides ſolùm ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificat non autem fides ſola:</hi> Faith alone juſtifieth, but not that Faith which is alone [without works.] becauſe that alone faith is not a true Faith; he 3. Makes a tranſition to fall out with all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches, for attributing too much to Faith, in making it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall to Iuſtification: that when Believers are ſaid to receive Chriſt, Io. 1. 12. and to receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteouſneſſe, Rom. 5. 17. wee will not ſay they receive this Chriſt, this gift of his Righteouſneſſe to Iuſtification, without any receiving inſtrument, but make Faith the inſtrument by which we receive the ſame. p. 299. A moſt pernicious Doctrine to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Cauſe. If it ſtand Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Iuſtification by workes in the ſame relation with Faith as its Concauſe, muſt needs fall and tumble downe to hell, for works will not be bowed into any inſtrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to co-operate with Faith in receiving Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When contrariwiſe, if we would ſay as he doth, and which we muſt take his word without any further demonſtration, to bee true, then in deſpite of Paul and the Holy Ghoſt, our juſtification ſhould be parted between faith and works, and Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſtand, the Goſpel of Grace being wholly taken out of the way as unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>But in all that he ſaith, hee diligently keeps off from ſpeaking a word to what our Divines ſay in proving from James himſelfe, that he means not true faith when hee denies to the counterfeit or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it any efficacy to juſtifie; and let the conſcientious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge whether he doth this in zeal for Chriſt or againſt him? Let none except that poſſibly hee never read any of them that have thus expounded James. What one of them hath he then read? Nay I rather queſtion what one of them hath he not read? or with what one thing is he unacquainted that any of them hath written? He is a ſtranger to Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> that will accuſe him of little reading. Even Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> himſelfe whoſe words hee can almoſt if not altogether rehearſe without book, gives it as the common interpretation of Proteſtant Writers, ſo that he cannot be ignorant of it. Yet he ſaith nothing to it, and ſaith all to what none denieth. Is this ſincerity in handling the chiefe point of mans ſalvation? Such as hee begged from God upon his knees? or the uſe of that which he injoyns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:167891:268"/> us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tenderneſs in the interpretation of Scriptures? But we muſt leave him in his own way becauſe hee is reſolute therein. Sith hee will not anſwer us, let us anſwer him, in theſe things which in ſtead of an anſwer to us, he would fiſh from the Text for himſelf.</p>

And this is that which he ſpeaketh. ver. 21. 22. 23. of Abrahams juſtification by works, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that Scripture which ſayth, Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. How did his juſtification by works fulfill the Scripture which affirmed him to be juſtified by faith? but as this great work and fruit of his faith declared and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to men the truth of that Scripture, and the truth of his faith by which he was ſo many yeers before juſtified.</p>

                        <p>All is granted as before, of the juſtification before men. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, or to ſay we have Faith is not ſufficient without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it by works ſo to juſtifie us.

This appears from his compariſon in the former verſe. 16 that this is the death he ſpeaks of. And ſo works make Faith alive as to the attainment of its end of Juſtification.</q>
                        <p>We grant that the hypocriticall profeſſion of Faith which <hi>James</hi> reproveth, is as all other ſinne, alive to condemne the unbelievers and unjuſtified, but dead to the uſe of juſtifying us in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before God, or outwardly before men.

                        <p>We except here againſt the Terms or Phraſes uſed in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and that 1. againſt that which by way of diſtinction, hee names our [FULL] Juſtification, implying thereby that there is an empty, or at leaſt partiall, maimed, and not full Iuſtification before God; as by what he hath oft ſaid before, &amp; by his own expreſſing himſelfe, and his meaning in the Explication of his Theſis he makes evident. The Proteſtants utterly deny this 1. and 2. partiall, and full, unperfect and perfect Iuſtification, acknowledging one onely Iuſtification of the New Covenant, which (as an act of God) is <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> perfect, admits of no degrees or increaſes, though as to a mans owne apprehenſion and comfort it hath its increaſes and decreaſes. And whatever Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath hitherto brought to proove on his part, wee have found no leſſe vaine than is that which hee ſeekes to prove. The Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>2. Againſt that which by the like way of diſtinction, hee calls our everlaſting ſalvation, implying thereby a temporary ſalvation which is by Chriſt, in reſpect whereof the ſaved may be unſaved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſo the ſalvation which they have by Chriſt become tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, not everlaſting. Both theſe wee deny and deteſt as Popiſh, Socinian, and Arminian doctrines; what audaciouſneſſe is it in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to name them, and not to prove them? to beguile his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Reader (not acquainted at all with Controverſies) with an opinion that theſe things are knowne and granted by Proteſtants, who deteſt the hearing of them, and with unreſiſtable arguments of Scripture oppugne the Authours of them: Wee ſhake off as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies in the Goſpel Doctrine of Iuſtification and Salvation, the Attributes which hee giveth in that ſence in which hee gives them. It is a bad Cauſe that ſeekes the ſupport of Sophiſtry and fallaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſupport it. Truth loves to bee attended with ſimplicity and plainneſſe, Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay why he puts theſe two diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attributes here; the thing in queſtion requires them not. But his rotten Cauſe will receive no appearance of ſupport by this Argument without them.</p>
                        <p>Againe as to the reſt of his Argument, why doth hee aſſume and conclude otherwiſe than he propoſed? The Propoſition ſpeaks of a <hi>Full</hi> Iuſtification, and an <hi>Everlaſting</hi> Salvation, but the aſſumption of a Salvation only, and the concluſion of a Iuſtification only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Attributes of <hi>Everlaſtingneſſe</hi> and <hi>Fullneſſe,</hi> Doth he not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:167891:270"/> know the falaciouſneſſe of ſuch Arguings? why then doth he uſe it? Is it becauſe he is wholly made of it, and cannot ſhun it? or becauſe his Cauſe is ſuch that it cannot ſtand without it? that to uſe plaine dealing will diſcover the deformity of it? or for the congruity which ſuch a kind of Argumentation hath with the cauſe, fallaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with falſhood? Let him either propoſe what he aſſumeth and concludeth, or elſe aſſume and conclude as he propoſeth. And then he muſt argue one of the two wayes, either firſt thus:</p>
                        <q>Our Full Juſtification and our Everlaſting Salvation have the ſame Conditions on our part. But ſincere obedience is without all doubt a condition of our Everlaſting Salvation. Therefore alſo of our full Juſtification.</q>
                        <p>Here the arguing is regular, but it is about immaginary things, ſuch as neither the word nor the Churches of Chriſt are acquainted with. Wee deny that in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſence there is any <hi>Full</hi> Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as oppoſite to a maimed, true Iuſtification, or any <hi>Everlaſting Salvation</hi> in his ſence, as oppoſite to a true ſpirituall ſalvation, that is temporary and tranſitory. So that his Arguing is the ſame as if he ſhould argue from <hi>Jupiters</hi> thunder to <hi>Jupiters</hi> lightning, or from <hi>Bellerophons</hi> horſe to <hi>Bellerophons</hi> ſaddle: when all theſe were Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, had their being only in immagination, not in reality.</p>
                        <p>Or ſecondly thus:
<q>Our Juſtification and our ſalvation have the ſame conditions on our part. But ſincere obedience is without doubt a condition of our ſalvation: Therefore alſo of our juſtification.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Heere I diſtinguiſh the word ſalvation, that it is taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (when by it is meant the everlaſting ſalvation of the whole man by Chriſt,) ſometimes for the ſtate of grace which wee attaine here, ſometimes for the ſtate of glory above. In the former ſenſe we finde it, 2. Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Now is the day of ſalvation,</hi> Luk. 19. 9. <hi>This day ſalvation is come to this houſe:</hi> So Acts 28. 28. Rom. 11. 11. Heb. 6 9. and in other places. In which ſenſe we are ſaid to be ſaved when we effectually receive the word of Chriſt, and Chriſt Jeſus to whom that word directeth for Salvation. 1 Cor. 1 18. <hi>To us that are ſaved,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 5, 8. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> So 1 Cor. 15. 2. 2 Cor. 2. 15. 2 Tim. 1. 9 Tit. 3. 5. and elſewhere. In all which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> is ſaid, wee <hi>are</hi> [not that we <hi>ſhalbe</hi>] ſaved: that Chriſt <hi>hath,</hi> [not that he <hi>will</hi>] ſave us. And the ſame is further confirmed in the word <hi>life,</hi> where Believers are ſaid to <hi>have life,</hi> 1 Io. 5 12. <hi>Everlaſting eternall life,</hi> Io. 3. 36 and 5. 24. and 6. 6, 47, 54. <hi>to bee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:167891:270"/> paſſed from death to life,</hi> Jo. 5. 24. All which proveth a life, eternall life, and everlaſting ſalvation, in this world that cannot be loſt, but ſhall have its coronation in glory above. In this ſenſe wee grant the Propoſition. ſo far as we have before granted any condition of juſtification. But we utterly deny the aſſumption. And what Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſaith, ſincere obedience is without all doubt a condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we affirme to be all the doubt, the whole thing in queſtion. If it be granted of ſalvation in this ſenſe, it muſt be granted of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alſo. Becauſe juſtification and ſalvation in this ſenſe are not 2 things but one &amp; the ſame. It being cal'd juſtification as we are freed &amp; delivered from the ſtate of miſery conſidered as a ſtate of ſin: and ſalvation, as we are delivered from the ſame miſery conſidered as a ſtate of wrath and condemnation. To ſay therfore that our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation have the ſame condition, is all one as to ſay our juſtification and our juſtification; or our ſalvation and our ſalvation have the ſame conditions: and wee might as well aſſume and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hence, Obedience is a condition of our ſalvation, <hi>Ergo</hi> of our ſalvation alſo, as of our ſalvation <hi>Ergo</hi> of our juſtification alſo.</p>
                        <p>In the latter ſenſe, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> take ſalvation for our future glorification then we utterly deny the conſequent of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is falſe that he ſaith, juſtification and ſalvation have the ſame conditions. For what is a conſequent of juſtification is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of ſalvation. And obedience [in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſence] can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a condition without the poſition whereof God doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, becauſe it followes juſtification and goeth not before it. And in this ſenſe I have oft ſpoken before to the <hi>minor,</hi> and ſhal have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak again. But let us ſee how he goeth about to prove his <hi>major</hi> propoſition.</p>

                           <hi>B.</hi> It would be as derogatory to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, if we be ſaved by works, as if we be juſtified by works.</q>
                        <p>Therefore we reject both. And let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> look to himſelfe for maintaining both.</p>

                        <p>The greater is his ſin that teacheth ſuch a way to juſtification as bars up the way to ſalvation, making it impervious and unpaſſable to Gods people. B. <hi>That which a man is juſtified by he is ſaved by.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is Chriſts mediation, or Chriſt the mediator, <hi>for there is ſalvation in no other, nor any other name given us under Heaven by which we may be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4. 12. <hi>By the righteouſneſs of</hi> [this] <hi>One, Grace came upon all to juſtification of life.</hi> So we are ſaved by Chriſt, and not by Condititions.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Though Glorification bee an adding of a greater happineſſe then we loſt; and ſo juſtification is not enough thereto: yet on our part they have the ſame Conditions.</q>
                        <p>This muſt be, becauſe hee will have it to bee the reſult of all his diſpute. But he only ſaith it, but proves it not. All that he layeth as the foundation of this Concluſion (excepting that which in other words is the concluſion it ſelfe) doth not infer it. For it being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he ſaith (but ſheweth not) that the Scripture ſaith it, that we are therefore juſtified that we may be ſaved, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to Salvation but by juſtification; and that it be as deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Chriſts righteouſneſs, to be ſaved as to be juſtified by works; will it follow for all this, that juſtification and ſalvation have the ſame conditions on our part? The reaſoning is one and the ſame in reaſon, as if I ſhould thus argue: Having 1. ſlandered the Scriptures, and ſaid, they ſay what I ſay, I ſhould further proceed. Therefore are we created that we may be ſaved; neither is there any way to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but by creation: It would be as derogatory to the grace of God to be created by our own working, as to be ſaved by our own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: Therfore though Glorification be adding of a greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe than we had by Creation, and ſo Creation is not enough ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet on our part they have the ſame conditions. The reaſoning after the Principles of true Proteſtants would not in its concluſion (though in its premiſes) ſeem altogether abſurd. Becauſe they affirm the abſolute will and good pleaſure of God, without any conditions on mans part (in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe of Conditions) to be the alone cauſe both of his creating and ſaving us.

                           <hi>B.</hi> Yet heer I ſay ſtill [our full Juſtification] becauſe as I have ſhewed [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſaid] our firſt poſſeſſion of it is upon our meer Faith, or contract with Chriſt. But <hi>I</hi> think our glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be acknowledged to have the ſame conditions with our finall juſtification at the bar of Chriſt: and why not to our entire continued juſtification upon earth?</q>
                        <p>Theſe are but words comparing that which is reall, with that which is but imaginary. We ſtill deny ſuch a full and finall juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the bar of Chriſt compleating that which was but unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, conditionall and reverſible heer upon earth. All that hee hath ſaid to prove it hath been examined and found inſufficient. We look for proof indeed, and meet with nothing but words. They that are once poſſeſſed of it by faith, are fully and finally poſſeſſed of it.</p>
                        <p>His peremptory and bold concluſion is now come (even upon his own grounds) to [I think;] and why had hee not kept his thoughts to himſelf untill he had known reaſon enough for rationall men to have concluded with him: yet upon this thought he addeth, and why not to our entire continued juſtification upon earth? To which we need ſay no more in anſwer but this, becauſe wee muſt not build any Article of our Faith upon the thoughts of men, but upon the word of God.</p>
                        <p>To the objection which hee ſuppoſeth ſome may make, and to which he anſwereth before it be made againſt him, I ſay no more, but let him anſwer our reall not imagined objections; and ſuch we ſhall ſo long defend untill by the light of the word wee finde them unworthy of defence.

Like that v 6. <hi>We are the houſe of Chriſt, if we hold faſt our confidence to the end,</hi> compared with 1 Jo. 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would without doubt have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> So the perſeverance; or not perſevering of theſe would manifeſt who had been, &amp; who had not been truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt, and the houſe of his habitation, not the condition of their perſevering juſtification, for then ſhould it be for a time at leaſt the condition of the perſeverance of their juſtification who were never truly pertakers of Chriſt, and conſequently in Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> phraſe, had never a beginning of juſtification.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſaid to confirme the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence he deſcendeth to prove the Aſſumption, <hi>That Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is an undoubted condition of our ſalvation.</hi> That wee may not here beat the winde, we do firſt underſtand his obedience to be the obedience of good workes, elſe is it the ſame with Faith, as I have ſhewed, and that of Faith in Scripture ſenſe, and not in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> large unſcripturall, and uncircumſcriptive definition. So much alſo many of the Scripture teſtimonies which hee alleadgeth here &amp; elſwhere (which I ſhal reduce to this place) declare. Yea him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in many places before hath ſet to his hand that it is his meaning.</p>
                        <p>2. We underſtand him here by Salvation to mean that which he a little before calls glorification, and not ſimply the ſalvation which is one and the ſame with Iuſtification.</p>
                        <p>But 3. We except againſt him, that whereas without ceaſing he beats our eares even into deafneſſe with that Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rampant, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick word [CONDITION,] ſcarce uttering a ſentence which he doth not bleſſe or curſe with it: though hee know the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath upon this Argument not the leaſt mention of it, that wee might thence learn; that it is but borrowed from the Papiſts, and improved much by the Arminians, with whoſe common language through his familiarity with both parties, hee is more acquainted than we can be who have no trafficque with them: yet he will not fully make knowne to us the meaning of the word, whether the ſignification thereof be boundleſſe, or within what limits it is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? whether it comprehends under it all the neceſſary Antecdents of glorification, or no? if ſo, whether it comprehends not under it as well much diſobedience as obedience, and works of the Divel as of God, as the <hi>Canſas ſine quibus non,</hi> we ſhall obtaine ſalvation by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:167891:272"/> Chriſt? Or whether by Conditions we muſt underſtand onely Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? and if ſo, whether thoſe alone which go before, or elſe alſo thoſe that accompany and follow juſtification and glorification? And withall, whether thoſe duties as morall or as ſpirituall? becauſe his Divinity being moſt drawne from naturall Philoſophers and Theologers, mounts not above Morality, tels us nothing of ſpirituall things that the Goſpel wholly treats of, ſhuns the very word [Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all] as a rock on which all the pride of man might ſuffer ſhipwrack, and the grace of God in Chriſt be alone exalted.

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe conditions are to be ſtretched, whether only ſo far as that only their abſence doth hinder, but their preſence doth not put or inferr juſtification and ſalvation as the effects, (in which ſence wee are wont to take the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi>) or elſe ſo far that both their abſence doth hinder, and their performance produce theſe effects? In theſe and many other things whereof I ſhalbe forced to ſpeake in its proper place, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not impart his meaning to us, that he may take his liberty to traverſe his ground, and under the name of Condition, aſcend and deſcend, run ſometimes in a wheele, and ſometimes in a race, play all in ſight, and leaſt in ſight, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, reſerving ſtill to himſelfe this advantage, to help himſelf with his Conditions, widening and ſtraitening them, making them the ſame with, or more than his <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> (having kept the power in his own hand) as it ſhalbe moſt inſervient to his ends. In the meane while wee are permitted onely to heare the humming and bombing, but not to ſee the buz, whether it be a Hornet or a Beetle.</p>
                        <p>What hee will not himſelfe directly tell us, wee muſt therefore take leave to gather from his writing as well as we can. In his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Theſis, even in that part thereof which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tranſcribed, being to prove that juſtification and ſalvation have the ſame Condition, hee tells us oft that we are both juſtified and ſaved by works. Here to follow his owne expoſition, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, pa. 300 that the word [<hi>By</hi>] implieth more than an idle (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and) concomitancy, if they only ſtand by while the work is in doing, it could not bee ſaid, we are juſtified by works. That it ſpeaks out works to have their agency and operation <hi>in procurement, or in that kind of cauſality which they have.</hi> And this is the ſame which under the 17. 18. and 19. Theſes he had before delivered, of a twofold Righteouſneſs, Chriſts Righteouſnes, and our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ours as abſolutely neceſſary as his to ſalvation, both [in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:167891:273"/> their kind] effectually procuring it. So in that which followeth in the explication, where, <hi>to be the condition of our ſalvation, and to have a hand in, or give right to juſtification,</hi> are put by him as the ſame thing, or as equipollent phraſes. So that under the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he involves all the <hi>Papiſts efficiency,</hi> and as much as (after their and his defining and modifying of Merits) is comprehended in their doctrine of Merits.</p>
                        <p>In this ſenſe therfore we deny Works or Obedience to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſalvation. 1. Becauſe thouſands are ſaved without works, <hi>viz.</hi> all that have been or ſhalbe ſaved being never in a capacity to work. 2. Becauſe the New Covenant in promiſing ſalvation makes it to follow grace and faith, not works, yea grace and faith in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to works, as hath been before ſhewed, cap. 15. of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation together. And that not by the vertue of <hi>that dung and rags and filth of mans righteouſneſs,</hi> wherwith Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the belly of his faith in the largeſt ſenſe, Theſ. 70. but by the vertue of Chriſt <hi>its object which it receiveth,</hi> Jo. 1. 12. <hi>and of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Becauſe if it be at all by works then wholly by works, Chriſt is excluded, will not profit, will be all or nothing, do all, without works, and give no place or partnerſhip to works with him in the buſineſs of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we bring any thing of works to ſave us, hee leaves us wholly to our works to ſave or damn us. <hi>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall not profit you, ye are debtors to the whole Law, i. e.</hi> If ye bring works in part to ſave you, yee muſt truſt wholly to works to ſave you, Chriſt is become of none effect to you, Gal. 5. 2. 3. 4. 5. Neither can they bee a condition in that way of cauſality to which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> profeſſes himſelfe to tie it, <hi>viz</hi> as the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non.</hi> For 1. the property of that kind of cauſality or conditionality not extended beyond it ſelf, can only by its abſence, deny the effect (as in this caſe the want of obedience and good works can onely deny them which refuſe or neglect them, to be ſaved or have right to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:167891:273"/> ſaved by them, no nor yet that they ſhall be ſaved. For if they can, it is by ſome other, and not by this kinde of cauſality which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> attributes to them. 2 Neither doth it (as himſelfe deſcribes its opperation in its cauſality to ſalvation) remove the impediments of ſalvation which are in generall ſinne, in particular chiefly unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. If good workes can remove theſe it may ſave. But it can neither remove the guilt of that which is paſt by way of purging it or ſatisfying for it; neither is it made inſtrumentall to put us into the poſſeſſion of Chriſts ſatisfaction and purging, for it precedes not but follows it (whatſoever Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath ſayd to the contrary.) Nor can it ſtop the flux of ſin and unbeleefe, but that it breaks out upon every of our good works to make them in themſelves evil and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and doth no further or otherwiſe remove, than by denying unbeliefe ſo far as we doe beleeve, and the neglect of duties as far as we have diligence and zeal to perform them. But this cannot bee called rightly the removing of the hindrances of our ſalvation: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of our ſalvation. 6. Becauſe ſalvation is the gift of Gods free grace, Ro. 6. 23. Jo. 10. 28. 2. Ti. 4. 8. But it is a payment of juſtice and not a gift of Grace, which is made the wages of works. <hi>Didſt thou not agree with me for a peny? Take what thine is</hi> [by contract and condition of the bargain] <hi>and go thy way,</hi> Mat. 20. 13. 14. Wheras contrariwiſe the free gift hath no other foundation or condition but Gods free love and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> Ro. 9. 15. So that <hi>it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> verſe 16. Many other Arguments have our Divines againſt the Papiſts about this queſtion, which I intreat the Reader to fetch from them for his fuller ſatisfaction. Now let us ſee what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> brings to prove, that obedience and good workes are the condition of our ſalvation.</p>

                        <p>Neither ſhall it be impertinent heer to take into conſideration ſome rules of our Divines for the right underſtanding of the minde of the holy Ghoſt in promiſing eternall life, unto perſons of ſuch and ſuch qualifications, or that perform ſuch and ſuch duties, before wee deſcend to examine the particular promiſes and teſtimonies which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> alleadgeth. Theſe are principally ſuch as follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That they belong (ſo farre as to bee effectuallized) to none elſe but ſuch as are vitally within the covenant of Grace, under the protection of the bloud of the Lamb in ſpirituall union with Chriſt. Jeſus the mediator of the new Covenant according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. <hi>All the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,</hi> [never effectuallized to them that are not in him] 2 Co. 1. 20. <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made, he ſaith not his ſeeds as of many, but of one, and to thy ſeed which was Chriſt. viz.</hi> in him alone, and to them alone to be confirmed which are in Chriſt. Gal 3. 16. Therfore the bleſſedneſs which Matthew in ſound of words ſeems to hold forth more generally Ma. 5 3. &amp;c. Luke as the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor of him, or rather of the mind of Chriſt in thoſe promiſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to the right objects or perſons to whom they were to bee made good, thus <hi>Jeſus lifted his eyes upon his diſciples and ſaid, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be [YEE] poor, for yours is the Kingdome of God. Bleſſed are YEE that hunger, YEE that weep &amp;c.</hi> implying that the bleſſedneſs was to come upon them, not by the vertue of theſe Acts and qualifications mentioned, but upon this ground alone that they were his Diſciples, by him Goſpellized and received into Covenant, this is that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo much preſſeth in ſuch promiſes to looke to the Root which is Chriſt, and that the reward is not from their works, becauſe they are holy, but becauſe they are holy or Saints which wrought them, and that they are thence ſaints from whence righteous, not from the works but from the Faith of the workers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That in ſuch promiſes the qualifications or works of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they are directed are mentioned not as the ground or foundation of the bleſſedneſſe promiſed, but to ſhew the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order which God obſerves in bringing them to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion therof. Becauſe he is holy, pure, ſpirituall, therfore he powrs into them his purifying, ſanctifying, and adopting ſpirit to conform them to his own will and nature, before hee brings them into the full and reall fruition of himſelf. So hee promiſeth all the heaven of felicities to the meek, the righteous, the ſaints, to them that love him, that fear him, that obey him; not therby inſinuating that hee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:167891:274"/> found them, but that he hath made, or will make them ſuch, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he will crown at laſt with glory. Heerin the power of that father of Spirits excelleth and exceedeth the power of the fathers of our bodies. He new creates their hearts new forms their wills, puts into them a new ſpirit, therby making them as Peter ſaith, <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and to enjoy the kingdome of God within them heer, before they be tranſlated to it above.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nevertheleſs the foundation of all theſe promiſes is not ſuch acts and qualifications in us, but the relation of ſons, in which wee ſtand before God. Such God beheld us in Chriſt before wee were born, ſuch hee hath made us that truly beleeve by the grace of the new Covenant, <hi>having begotten us to himſelf of incorruptible ſeed,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 23. <hi>we are born of God, and have received the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which we cry Abba, Father:</hi> So that our ſalvation dependeth not upon the vertues and good works which are mentioned in the promiſes, but upon this our relation of ſons: <hi>if ſons then heirs, &amp;c.</hi> Ro. 8. 15. as a ſpeciall friend of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> who walks by the ſame rule and the ſame ſpirit with him hath acknowledged, heerin conſenting with our Divines and ſtoutly maintayning their Aſſertion, at leaſt becauſe it ſeemed to give ſome fulture to his cauſe. And I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> will not heer leave him whom in all the reſt he followeth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Yet what the Lord giveth to and hath prepared of endleſſe glory for his children as his children, he doth oft-times hold forth and promiſe to them as a reward of ſuch gifts of grace in them, and of works which they have done, or ſufferings that they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for his ſake. Not but that it was provided for them and promiſed to them, before all ſuch works and ſufferings as they were children: but for ſome other honourable ends, which I ſhall in part mention, having firſt inſtanced ſome promiſes of this kind. Before the birth of Iſaac long, had the Lord of free grace promiſed to Abraham all bleſſedneſs corporall and ſpirituall, preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>that his ſeed ſhould be as the duſt of the earth, as the ſtars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven numberleſs, that he ſhould bee bleſſed, and in him all nations of the earth be bleſſed: that the land of Canaan the type and the eternall land of Promiſe the Antitype</hi> ſhould be his and his ſeeds for ever. Ge. 12 2. 3. and 13. 15. 16. and 15. 1-6. and 17. 1-8. Yet afterward cha. 22. when Abraham had ſhewed that notable fruit of his faith, fear, and love to God, in offering his ſon Iſaac in obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, God called from heaven to him by an Angel, and ſayd. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:167891:275"/> with held thy ſon, thy only ſon, That in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars in heaven, and as the ſand &amp;c. and in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice,</hi> Ge. 22. 15-18. We ſee heer that promiſed as a reward of this act of obedience of Abraham, which God had by promiſe made ſure to him before ever hee offered his ſon, or had the ſon to offer. To this I might annex the harmony of Scriptures, that teſtifying the kingdome of glory <hi>to be prepared</hi> for them that ſhall enjoy it, <hi>from the beginning of the world; purchaſed for them by Chriſts death,</hi> Mat. 25. 34.

                           <hi>B. Heb. 5. 9.</hi> Chriſt is the Author of eternall ſalvation to them that obey him.</q>
                        <p>This Scripture makes againſt him not for him. 1.

                        <p>He alleadgeth not the words, and may bee aſhamed to quote the place to prove the ſalvation which is by the Goſpel, to follow the tenour of works; knowing that the Apoſtle there goeth about to convince the Jews that the Law cannot ſave them, by ſhewing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what terms ſalvation runneth under the Legall or old Covenant.</p>

                        <p>The doing of Chriſts commandements heer, is the ſame which Heb. 5. 9. is called the obeying of Chriſt, and the meaning of both is there explained.

But if he underſtand by the Law of Liberty the Goſpel, then hath it the ſame ſenſe with the former Scriptures, teacheth us to ſeek ſalvation in a Goſpel way, as a free gift from free grace as children of liberty whom the ſon hath made free, and not as children of bondage by works.

                           <p>The Scriptures that he brings to prove that the juſtifying ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhall paſſe according to workes, as well as Faith are firſt here put and therefore firſt to be examined. And againſt his reaſoning from them I except. 1. [as well as Faith] is here foyſted in being wanting in the poſition. And why heere ſupplyed but to beguile the ſimple with a good opinion of his aſſertion as if he attributed ſomething to Faith alſo in Chriſts and Pauls ſenſe. When contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he teacheth that Faith hath nothing to doe in this buſineſſe, but in the notion of our Act, our righteouſneſſe or worke, ſo that with him to be juſtified by Faith is to be juſtified by our owne worke. 2. That there is no one of theſe Scriptures but is alledged by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> and his fellows againſt the Proteſtants, and by them fully anſwered &amp; manifeſted to make nothing for juſtification or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works, ſcripture after ſcripture, no one of them pretermitted. When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> now ſtands up in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> place againſt us, is it ſufficient for him to tel us what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath ſaid againſt the truth (as if we could not without him know it) and to leave unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yea unmentioned the hundreds of our ſide that have retorted upon him his owne arguments to the ſubverting of his owne cauſe, that by theſe Scriptures he would have maintained? If he would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:167891:282"/> have another anſwer; ought he not to have excepted againſt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidety of thoſe that have beene already given? Is he worthy to heare more from vs that hath ſtopped his eares againſt all that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthies have ſaid already, ſcorning to take notice thereof? Nay when he will onely alledge the Scriptures, and not take the labour to tel us what or how he will conclude from them he leaves us not in a capacity to declare ſo much as our conſent with him or diſſent from him. Yet for the uſe of the weaker ſort of readers that have not ability to make recourſe to thoſe learned workes where theſe controverſies are handled, or to underſtand them in that language in which moſt of them are written; I ſhal ſpeak ſomething in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all theſe Scriptures.</p>
                           <p>Firſt of that of Mat. 25. 21. 23. or rather taking the whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, beginning at ver. 14. and ending at v. 30. granting it on both ſides to be the ſame Parable which <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth chap. 19. beginning at the 12. and ending at the 27. verſe, (which very few have queſtioned, no one hath had cauſe to deny) then it ſuits not at all with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> purpoſe, or his Judgement dayes juſtification.

The matter of the Account is what each by his ſerious ſtudies and labours had cleared up to himſelfe and others of this Goſpel and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt before his comming for the advancement and advantage of Chriſt at his comming.

And ſo the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comprehends in it a Prophecy of the ſucceſſe of the Kingdome of Grace, now in the way of erecting in its power; as to the Iews: So ſaith <hi>Luke</hi> in that 19. Chapter, verſe 11. <hi>Hee added and ſpake a parable becauſe he was nigh to Jeruſalem,</hi> and becauſe they thought <hi>that the Kingdom of God ſhould immediatly appeare,</hi> by this Parable foretelling them that the Citizens, the Children of the Kingdom, the Iews for their rejection of Chriſt ſhould bee <hi>caſt out into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> i. e. into blindneſſe of minde and ſtubbornneſſe of heart, accompanied with all calamity and miſery, as we ſee them undergoing untill this day. This I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be but my owne private opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſuch as I could eaſily manifeſt from the Text it ſelfe (if occaſion were) to be very probable, if not certainely the minde of Chriſt.

                           </p>
                           <p>But if we are to underſtand all of Chriſts laſt Comming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it miniſters nothing to advantage Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Cauſe, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ruinate it: For firſt the faithfull Servants that ſhall bee ſo richly rewarded, are ſuch as wrought with a free ſpirit, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which they received was a free gift, they challenged it not in St. Conditions name, and Chriſt confers it freely as their muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Lord. That hee mentions their ſervice argues not either dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or deſert in their ſervice, but the riches of his grace that having juſtified their perſons, hee had in regard their ſervice alſo. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant caſt into utter darkneſſe, is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> legall man, ſerving with a mercenary and ſlaviſh ſpirit, expects nothing from Chriſt but in the way of juſtice, lookes upon him as upon <hi>an Auſtere man, a ſtrait Law-giver, and a rigorous exactor of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his Lawes; I knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou haſt not ſowne, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed, and I was afraid,</hi> (ſaith he) and ſo did nothing becauſe of his feare of ſo ſtrict a Lord, at leaſt nothing to purpoſe, nothing to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of the <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> within himſelfe or others.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Scripture, Mat. 25. 34. 35. is moſt plain (ſayth Mr.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:167891:283"/> 
                              <hi>Baxter</hi>) in which the mouth of the Judge himſelfe deſcribeth the order of the proceſſe of that day; <hi>Come ye bleſſed inherit &amp;c. For I was hungry &amp;c.</hi> The Judges mouth deſcribes, but why doth Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> mouth refuſe to ſpeak out the deſcription which the Judge maketh of the proceſſe of that day? If hee began at ver. 31. <hi>when Chriſt is ſet in his throne to call all Nations before him, to judgement, he declares the maner of the proceſſe, 1. by ſeparating the ſheep from the goats, 2. by ſetting the ſheep at his right hand.</hi> What the ſheep were himſelf declares, Jo. 10. ſuch as <hi>hear his voice, his Goſpel voice</hi> and are Goſpellized and ſpirituallized by it. What hee means by his right hand, the Apoſtle declares, 1. Theſſ 4 16 17. <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, and ſhall bee caught up in the clouds to meet with the Lord in the ayre:</hi> What to do? not only <hi>to be with the Lord, but alſo,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>to ſit with him in judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to judge the world,</hi> 1. Co. 6. 2. This is the right hand of Chriſt, to which the ſaints perhaps ſhall bee advanced, even before the dead out of Chriſt ſhall be rayſed. To this at laſt is annexed what Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> alleadgeth, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world</hi> Who ſeeth not heer the grounds of their glorification to bee, that they were Chriſts ſheep? the heirs of God, and his elect veſſels? That they are to be convened before Chriſt, not as priſoners to bee judged, but to bee owned as his juſtified ones, and to receive the glorious fruits of their juſtification and adoption, a Kingdome by inheritance; yea to ſit as partners and Commiſſioners with Chriſt in judging the world? what the Lord Ieſus addeth, for I was hungry &amp;c and yee thus and thus miniſtred unto me; will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> becauſe of the word <hi>for,</hi> conclude theſe offices to be the cauſe of their juſtification? then let him alſo conclude, that the cauſe of Gods ſhewing mercy to <hi>Paul</hi> was his ignorance and unbeliefe. This will as well follow from thoſe words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13. <hi>I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbeliefe.</hi> To his condition the proper place is to ſpeak afterward.</p>
                           <p>So the 1 Pet. 1. 17. who without reſpect of Perſons judgeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every mans work, holds forth thus much to us, that God cannot be deluded or corrupted, as oft times earthly Iudges are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pervert juſtice for favour or carnall ends, or to take ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances for ſubſtance, but jugeth all both perſons and actions according to what they are, not what they ſeem.</p>
                           <p>In like mnner, 2 Cor. 5. 10. the Apoſtle appeales (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:167891:284"/> by the 11. and 12. verſes compared with this) from the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and cenſures of the falſe Apoſtles to the judgment Seat of God. They had (it ſeems) queſtioned among the Corinthians, the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of both the Apoſtle and his Miniſtry: Hee refers all to Chriſt the Iudge. Before him wee muſt all appeare (ſaith he) and hee will reveale who are the ſincere, and which the hypocriticall Profeſſors and Preachers of Chriſt, they or I to take vengeance of the one, and to owne the other.</p>
                           <p>He maimeth that teſtimony of Rev. 20. 12, 13. that the force ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may not be underſtood by his Reader. Let him ſupply what he hath cut off, the Book of life by which they which are in Chriſt are to be judged, which is there mentioned aſwel as the other books by which the world is to be judged, and then the judgments which the Saints are to paſs through wil appear to be a judgment of Grace, not of ſtrict juſtice; &amp; to conſiſt in their admiſſion to the Kingdom after the tenour of Grace, not of Workes. The other three Scriptures he ſeeth to have ſo little even of ſhew in them for his uſe, that he deigns not the labour to alleage the words; and let him not expect that I ſhould ſtil do it for him.</p>
                           <p>Thus far we grant that the ſentence of Iudgement (though not the juſtifying ſentence) ſhall paſſe in the laſt day according to works. 1. The whole world that hath not heard of Chriſt, much leſs beleeved on him, ſhall be judged according to their works, to life or death, according as their works have been perfect or unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: yea to a meaſure of vengeance anſwering to the meaſure of their ſinnes, ſome to many, ſome to fewer ſtripes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The whole bulk of profeſſed Chriſtians alſo ſhall [in this reſpect] be judged according to their works: <hi>viz.</hi> that as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of and actings in Chriſt, were eyther in truth or in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, meerly formall, or elſe Vitall and reall, ſo ſhall they be either exempted from, or adjudged unto vengeance. And ſo the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall bee then diſcloſed, the Sheep and Goats, Saints and Hypocrites ſhall then bee fully ſeperated one from the other, which untill that time ſhall never be wholly done, nor bee known to all whoſe works were vitall, and whoſe dead works.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That the very Saints as compared one with another, ſhall be judged according to their works, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall be adjudged to glory in ſeverall meaſures above, according to the ſeverall meaſures of their ſervices and ſufferings heere, is the opinion of many, eminent for learning and godlineſs; neither doe their Reaſons yet wholly ſway
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:167891:284"/> me who diſſent from them, and will have neither right hand nor left hand, nor ſun, nor ſtars, nor great, nor ſmall, but all equall in one degree of glory. It is no proper place heer to diſpute it, but I ſee no reaſon to conclude that hee which diſtributeth his gifts of grace heer in different meaſures, may not ſo alſo there diſtribute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory. Seeing both are by the purchaſe of his death, and whether by the former he puts us in a greater or leſſer capableneſs of the later, is in queſtion.</p>
                           <p>But in any other ſenſe, how (as he ſayth) the ſentence of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhall paſſe according to works, and that as hee infers from 2. Co. 5. 10. according to works, whether good or evill, I cannot conjecture. 1. Not according to works as they are a condition, (which is the next thing hee undertakes to prove) for evill works cannot be the condition of our juſtification, either negatively that if we have done evill, we neyther are nor ſhalbe juſtified; then all muſt bee damned: nor poſitively, that whoſoever hath done evill, ſhall be juſtified; then all ſhall be ſaved. Nor 2. ſhall it paſſe ſo as that according to our good works we ſhall be juſtified, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our evill works we ſhall be condemned; then every man, at leaſt every true Chriſtian, ſhould be both ſaved and damned. 3 Nor that we ſhalbe much juſtified if we have all good works, &amp; little ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified if we have done ſome evil works alſo, for that is the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where every man ſhall have a full diſcharge or no diſcharge. I muſt leave this as one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Myſteries, it muſt die with him (as to my underſtanding,) unleſs hee vouchſafe his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>As for the thing it ſelfe, I utterly deny that they which are in Chriſt ſhall be ſo judged or juſtified according to their works as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, that they ſhall ſtand as priſoners with the world at the bar of Chriſt, to bee judged for life and death as the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their works. What that the Lord Chriſt ſhould then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nakedneſs, and lay open in the ſight of men and divels all the ſin and ſhame of his beloved members? That he ſhould caſt in their faces all the filth of all their originall and actuall pollution even when they are upon the threſhold of heaven? Let it be Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> doctrine, my eares are abhorrent from the ſound thereof.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:167891:285"/> gives him all, naming him therin his good and beloved ſon that hath done him great ſervice, miniſtred to him much comfort in the time of his neceſſity.

Could not the Father have hired a ſtranger for a few Crowns to have done him as much ſervice? Doth not the mentioning of the ſons good deeds which he would ſeem to reward with ſo rich munificence, ſpeak out only the remarkable goodneſs of the Father, that hath buried in oblivion all the diſobedience and miſchiefs which his ſon hath committed, and will have his good parts alone to be mentioned? or if another that was not his ſon had done a thouſand times more in his ſervice ſhould he have been entitled for it to the inheritance? So alſo in this caſe to attribute to the works of beleevers the reaſon or ground of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification becauſe the Grace of Chriſt mentioneth them, is to lay the honour of Chriſts Grace in the duſt.

                           <p>It is therefore denyed that the juſtifying ſentence (as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> termes it) ſhall paſse in the laſt day either for or according to works, otherwiſe than hath beene before granted. And if wee ſhall not at laſt be glorified according to and for our workes, but that Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> proofes in this particular faile; Then is his labour loſt in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove the ſecond particular that the reaſon hereof is becauſe they are parts of the condition.

So that we will not contend about the ſecond particular with him, to deny what he concludeth, that workes concurre in the ſame concauſality with Faith to our glorification, 1. Not to evidence the truth of our Faith, nor ſecondly as the righteouſneſſs which the Law requireth, not thirdly as a meer ſigne by which God doth diſcern our Faith, nor fourthly as a mere ſign to ſatisfie the juſtified perſon himſelfe, nor fiftly to ſatisfie the condemned world of the ſincerity of our Faith. All this we grant, and further adde in the ſixt place nor as a condition (in Mr <hi>Baxters</hi>) ſenſe of our glorification. And becauſe none of theſe or other wayes, therefore not at all.</p>

                           <p>The Scriptures which he brings pa. 322. n. 5. that ſeeme to hold forth the promiſe of glorification for our workes, are of the ſame nature with thoſe examined in the former Chapter alleaged by him and all (as thoſe) gathered by the Papiſts to his hand, and either do conclude no more than what a little before we have in this Chapter granted, or pertaine to ſome of thoſe ends of ſuch promiſes of life which God maketh to our obedience, ſpecified in the former chap.

                        <p>The Propoſition is granted him. The Aſſumption hee goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cleer and make good, by enumerating the particular abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and miſchiefs that are conſequentiall to this Doctrine. And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:167891:286"/> this he doeth by way of interrogations bearing the force of ſtrong Affirmations. I ſhal examine them in order. The firſt query he puts in theſe words.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Doth it not needleſly conſtraine men to wreſt moſt plaine and frequent expreſſions of Scripture?</q>
                        <p>A ſimple negation would here beſt ſuit with ſo untoward and audatious a queſtion? Neither ſhall I ſay any more to it, but admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Reader to take notice, that hee doth in theſe words frame an enditement againſt Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all that beare the name of Proteſtants, for ſacriledge in wreſting the holy Scriptures. And that, 1. Though he doth not (and why? but becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) bring any one Scripture which they have ſo wreſted. 2. And thereby affirmeth plaine enough to the capacity of every underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reader, that the Papiſts and <hi>Arminians</hi> alone have purely and truely interpreted the Scriptures as to the point of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whom himſelfe therefore followeth as their obedient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And 3. ſhewes us no reaſon therof, but leaves us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture what his meaning is, <hi>viz</hi> that the Scripture is no farther Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, than after the interpretation and ſenſe which the holy Mother Church alloweth it.</p>
                        <p>Nay we retort the argument upon him. Iuſtification by works conſtraines the aſſertors thereof not onely to wreſt many Scriptures, but alſo to deſtroy and nullifie the whole Goſpell and Salvation of Chriſt. Therefore it is falſe doctrine.</p>
                        <p>This firſt query was but a warning peece, but who can ſtand to beare the force of the ſecond? The man as if hee had newly come forth of <hi>Vulcans</hi> ſhop, is all fiery, ſpits out nothing but lightening and thunderbolts, blowing into the bottome of Hell all that ſtand in his way. How formidably he layes about him, they that dare to come ſo neer may finde partly in this ſecond querie it ſelfe, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in his Appendix pag. 76. &amp;c. and in the higheſt ſtrength of his wrath, pag. 83. and onward to the end of pag. 98.

And if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practiſe by all that hold it, (as I hope it is not) would undoubtedly damn them, for he that ſeeks not, and ſtrives not to enter, ſhall never enter. Now if good workes, or ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt our Lord, be no part of the condition of our full juſtification and ſalvation, who will uſe them to that end?

                        <p>But that the Apoſtle alſo teacheth that we are not to performe good works and duties that we may be juſtified and ſaved by them, is evident. <hi>To him that worketh</hi> (ſaith he) i. e. ſeeketh it by works, <hi>the reward is reckoned not of grace but of debt,</hi> ſhall be conferred on him if due in ſtrict Iuſtice, he muſt expect nothing from grace. <hi>But to him that worketh not</hi> [ſeeks not the attainment therof by works] <hi>his Faith is imputed to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Ro. 4. 4. 5. to which he addeth the teſtimony of David, <hi>pronouncing the man bleſſed to whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes.</hi> ver. 6, 7, 8 <hi>By

                        <p>As to the matter it ſelfe, it is all ſophiſticall and fallatious that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here delivereth. Let him bring that <hi>Antinomian</hi> to light that hath ever taught that we muſt not labour and ſtrive for juſtification and ſalvation, againſt whom his Argument may holde good that he muſt needs bee damned, becauſe he that ſeeketh not and ſtriveth not to enter ſhall never enter. Some indeede by expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves too briefly have given occaſion to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and ſuch as he is, to catch a phraſe or ſentence from them that may ſmel of ſome abſurdity as conſidered in it ſelfe and by its ſelfe: ſuch as is that which he heer mentioneth, we muſt work from life, and not for life. But if the ſcope of the Authors in ſuch phraſes be gathered, from that which went before, and that which followeth, it will appear clearly they meant, we are not to work and perform duties to this end that wee may bee juſtified and ſaved by ſuch works as works and duties, but to perform them in love and thankfulneſs to him that juſtifieth us freely of meer grace, without works, through the Redemption which is by Chriſt Jeſus. And this is the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the Papiſts on the one part, and the Antinomians, <hi>i e.</hi> the Proteſtants on the other part, whether wee muſt perform good works and duties to bee juſtified and ſaved by them and for them ſo performed, yea by them or for them as they are our inherent righteouſneſs, our perfect, poſſible, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Righteouſneſs? All which he affirms, and the Proteſtants with one conſenting voice deny: as hath been before, and may after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we part from Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> be more fully manifeſted.</p>
                        <p>What he concludes with as a notable abſurdity and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that will befall his doctrine of works, if we will not ſay what he ſayth: [viz. <hi>If good works bee no part of the Condition of our full juſtification and ſalvation, who will uſe them to that end? For how it can procure juſtification as a means, and not be the condition therof, I cannot conceive.</hi>] Beſides his fallacy before noted in arguing from juſtification and ſalvation ſimply and indefinitely taken, to a full juſtification and ſalvation of his own deviſing, and ſo controverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly again from this latter to that former: it concerns him to look to the inconvenience and danger, which uſeth and practiſeth, not to us which uſe not good works to that end. And now is his time to conſider, that his full juſtification, when hee thinks to poſſeſſe it, do not evaporate into no juſtification, no ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Now to make way for the examination of what hee hath more largely to this purpoſe in his Anſwer to the tenth &amp; eleventh Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:167891:288"/> in his Appendix, and to ſhew how hee there fights with his own phantaſm, feigns an Adverſary and then quells him, falls out with his own ſhadow, never comming neer that which hee hath made to be the Queſtion between him and the Proteſtant Churches, but when the Adverſary is Eaſtward, hee rides out in indignation Weſtward, beating every buſh and wounding every bough that he meets with, proclayming it an Adverſary, and ſo returns at laſt with as much gallantry, as ever did <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: it ſhall be expedient (for the diſabuſing of ſuch as are apt in this kind to bee abuſed) to premiſe ſomething for the right ſtating of the Queſtion heer controverted.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then the doings, duties, and works, about which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is converſant, are of two kinds, Legall or Evangelicall, ſuch as have their foundation in that law which is of Natural and Moral, or ſuch as are founded on precepts and doctrines of Goſpell Poſitive right. By the former I mean ſuch works and duties as the naturall conſcience (ſpecially if holpen by the written Law) can apprehend to be, and urge upon man as duty though there had never been a Chriſt or Goſpell to adde further light. By the later I meane ſuch duties, as are only in generall comprehended in the Law, [whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord ſhall at any time declare to bee his will, and impoſe upon thee as thy duty, thou ſhalt obſerve and do] but cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be known in ſpeciall to bee duties, without a new revelation from heaven, ſuch as the Goſpell is. The former duties are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, founded in Nature it ſelfe: the later ſupernaturall, becauſe without a ſupernaturall manifeſtation they cannot be known, and without a ſupernaturall power infuſed they cannot bee effectually performed. All this Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> himſelfe granteth in this his Treatiſe, ſaving the very laſt clauſe, which alſo becauſe I finde him not any where flatly denying, I ſhall forbear to prove, taking it as granted with the reſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That this naturall righteouſneſs and obedience was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Old Covenant, as to life, and ſo remayneth ſtill to them that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remayn under the Old Coveant, but ſo as that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can be ſaved by it ſince Adams fall, but that whoſoever is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the ſame is ſaved after the tenour of the New Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Covenant of Grace or the Goſpel. This alſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath frequently taught and granted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the duties of the New Covenant are of two ſorts, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſſe principall; the more principall is fayth, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:167891:289"/> and embracing the Lord Chriſt, together with the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation that are by him. The leſſe principall duties (which are alſo pure Goſpel duties) are ſuch as are ſubſervient to faith, or to the receiving of Chriſt alone to juſtification, quickening, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſanctification, &amp;c. or to the reteyning of him and fuller cloſing with him to all theſe &amp; all other Evangelical ends for which he is given to us by the Father. Theſe 3. Poſitions are ſo frequently granted by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this his Book, that I forbear to quote the places.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That juſtification and ſalvation, as the Scripture terms them a reward, (if indeed it doth ever ſo term juſtification, as properly and ſtrictly taken) may bee conſidered firſt as benefits already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and in our poſſeſſion, in part or in the whole, or elſe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heerafter to be conferred; the ground and foundation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was layd in our firſt converſion and union to Chriſt by faith, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the earneſt and pledge of the ſpirit given to us by God to aſſure us of our full poſſeſſion of all the fruits therof in the future.

At length when all is done, ſuch a begger hath more apparent grounds of boaſting that hee hath been, and done ſomewhat to his owne enriching, than the beſt of us that we have been or done any thing to our own Juſtification. For though the Benefactor hath poured upon him freely of his own mercy, not for, or upon condition of his crying, running to him, emptying his hand of what was in it before, and ſtretching it forth to bee filled with the treaſure profered him: yet the benefactor gave him neither a heart to deſire nor wiſdome to value, nor light to guide him, nor feet to carry him, nor a hand to receive the treaſure conferred.

                        <p>Theſe four Concluſions I know none of the Proteſtant (or as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> terms them Antinomian) Teachers denying.

Theſe things therefore thus premiſed, it is eaſie to anſwer all that he will ſeeme to himſelfe to have laid impregnably for juſtification by works in his Appendix.</p>
                        <p>To begin with pag. 76. of that his Appendix, and paſſing over that bold peremptory Phariſaicall and popiſh Aſſertion, that <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> is the language both of the Law and the Goſpel, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the explication and feigned ſenſe of [<hi>Doe and live</hi>] as it is the voice of the Goſpel, p. 77. (there being nothing for, but all againſt this doctrine throughout the whole Goſpel, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fully proved) all that he brings for the confirmation of it in the ſenſe in which he will be underſtood, is ineffectuall to this end. All his poſiions pag. 78, 79, 80. may in the ſenſe before mentioned, be granted him, <hi>viz. 1. That a wicked man or unbeliever may and muſt labour to obtaine the firſt life of Grace. 2. That a man may act for the increaſe of this ſpirituall life when he hath it. 3. That we may and muſt act for the life of Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:167891:291"/> 4. <hi>That we may act for the aſſurance of both our Juſtification and Sanctification. 5. That wee may act for Eternall Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All theſe things are wholly beſides the queſtion, and no more either powerfull or proper to prove that [Do and live] (in the ſenſe which he affirmeth and all Proteſtans deny) to be the voice and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or ſcope of the Goſpel, than if he had ſaid nothing at all. He might expect the beguiling of the ſimple, but not of any knowing and conſiderative perſon with this diſpute of his totally alien from the matter about which he diſputeth. For himſelfe knoweth, that they which uſe this Phraſe, [<hi>We muſt work from life, not for life</hi>] do in this expreſſion. 1. Speak only of thoſe that are already alive in Law againe, <hi>i. e.</hi> juſtified and abſolved from all their ſins through faith in Chriſts bloud, and ſo delivered from the Curſe and death of the Law: 2. That they mean principally, if not only the <hi>the life of Juſtification, reconciliation, and Adoption,</hi> that they which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this life, are already alive before God of meere Grace, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to Chriſt which is their Life, ought not to ſeek the ſame life by works, as if it were not already attained; for this were to reject Grace and Chriſt as inſufficient to Life, and to flye to works as either alone ſufficient, or without which Grace and Chriſt are not ſufficient to it. 3. That if at any time by and under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they comprize beſides the life of Juſtification, &amp;c. here, the life of glory hereafter alſo; in excluding our acting and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, they exclude them only as our acts and workes, <hi>i. e.</hi> as acts and works either of Gods worſhip, or of righteouſneſs and charity towards our neighbour commanded by the Law of Nature, by the righteouſneſſe thereof to live: Not thoſe Goſpel duties of Gods ordination to be ſubſervient to our union unto and receiving of Chriſt to bee our alone righteouſneſſe by which to live. This way themſelves doe, and teach all, both believers and unbelievers to act for life. The ſum of their doctrine about Juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breathing out it ſelfe in calling all from all iniquity to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Chriſts bloud for cleanſing, and from all confidence in the righteouſneſs of their owne workes to put on him alone for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone righteouſneſſe at Gods Tribunall. Whatſoever acting and working there is in ſelfe-ſearching, ſelfe-denyall, ſelfe-renouncing, whatſoever in the ſtudy, knowing, deſiring, ſeeking, comming to Chriſt, that they may receive and retaine him to bee their ſole and whole life and righteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>All this they doe, and teach to bee done and that for life. This
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:167891:292"/> way (ſay they) the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it (yea hold it alſo) by force. Nevertheleſs even theſe Actings they diſclaim alſo as by their righteouſneſs intereſſing to Chriſt and life in him; and will no otherwiſe act by theſe for life, but as they are ordinately ſubſervient to Faith and to living by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Chriſt whom Faith apprehendeth. Even Faith it ſelfe [as an act or work juſtifying] they explode, leaving it to the Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, and among theſe to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which heere pag. 80. of his Appendix, as elſewhere teacheth it.</p>
                        <p>So the queſtion is not, when God of the freeneſs and riches of his Grace, doth offer unto us Chriſt with Righteouſneſs, and life in him as a free gift; whether we ought to act and work for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and holding of it, or not? But whether wee ought to work ordinately as God preſcribeth, or inordinately as Mans mad God Reaſon fancieth. We only deny that when ſuch a gift is ſo offered we ought to run with fiſt, foot, ſword, and club, to force it out of Gods hand as our due, (as they doe which after the doctrine of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Maſters invade God with their works, to claime it as due to their righteouſneſs;) But we teach men tolie proſtrate in the ſenſe of their own vileneſs, gaſping after it and receiving it as a free gift of Mercy; granting man in the very firſt acting of his will toward Chriſt, and Gods acting upon him to draw him to Chriſt, the relation of more then a naturall patient, (not pronouncing him a ſtock or ſtone as our Adverſaries object to us) even of obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubjection (as they term it in the Schools) and ever after of a free Agent to fetch life and motion from Chriſt by the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>Thus far and no further doe we grant [doe and live] to bee the voyce of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> as there is a doing in receiving Chriſt and adhering to him; and as the will in receiving Chriſt, is as well an Agent as a Patient. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſenſe wee reject, and have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his reaſons heer brought to confirm it. And whatſoever he hath ſayd elſwhere, hath been before examined.</p>
                        <p>As to the Scriptures which he quoteth to confirm his 5. Poſition, p. 80. and his glorying that they prove wee may act for ſalvation, p. 81. which as generally poſited by him no man ever denied: there is no need of anſwering, that which they are brought to prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted. At length in the ſame pa. 81. of his App. he frameth an objection made againſt his doctrine thus:</p>

                        <p>To this Objection he gives a three fold Anſwer.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax. Anſw. 1.</hi> If it come not from love to God it is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But is it ſincere if it come from love to God? Is there not aſwell a naturall love as a naturall fear of God in the hearts of all both good and bad? Or was there ever any that hated God as God and good? Or that ſerved him from hatred to him? If ſuch a Naturall or Morall Love (for I finde not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> aſcending any where higher,) ſuffice to make the obedience of men ſincere, and becauſe ſincere, a perfect and ſufficient righteouſnes to juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Then all will more fitly cohere than the golden crowne with the golden pantofle: a univerſall conditioning righteouſneſs, with a univerſall conditionall ſalvation. All ſhall be ſaved (except the Antinomian Paulites, or Proteſtants) if Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Goſpel ſtand: if he miſſe, none elſe but they.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> 2. Yet doth not the Goſpel any where ſet our love to God and to our own ſouls in oppoſition; nor teach us to love God and not our ſelves: but contrarily joyneth them both together, and commandeth them both. The love of our ſelves and deſire of our own preſervation, would never have been planted ſo deeply in our nature, by the God of Nature, if it had been unlawfull.
<p>I conclude therefore, that to love God and not our ſelves, and ſo to do all without reſpect to our own good, is no Goſpel frame of ſpirit.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>As home to the matter as his doctrine of Juſtification to the truth. Where was conſcience when will and wit alone ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to beguile his Readers with meere opinions and imaginary ſuſpitions? Who ever oppoſed the ordinate love of God to the ordinate and ſubordinate love of our ſelves? When he hath degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:167891:293"/> us from being men, yea into a ſtate beneath Beaſts and bruits, telling the world that we doe not <hi>appetere bonum,</hi> deſire and move unto any thing that is good, yea our chiefe good, thenceforth hee thinks the world in ſtead of hearing will trample us, as other ſtocks and ſtones that have no ſenſitive appetite. Our doctrine is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frame. Wee oppoſe the love of God which is from the ſpirit of Adoption, (not from Nature) to the ſervile feare which is from the ſpirit of Bondage: following heerin the light and teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, Ro. 8. 15. 1. Jo. 4. 18. And this I doubt not, to be alſo the meaning of the Apoſtle, Gal. 5. 6. where hee makes the all on our part to juſtification, conſiſt in Faith, which worketh by love, <hi>i. e.</hi> in faith which carrieth out the beleever to work, no more in ſlaviſh fear and by a mercenary ſpirit, but in the freedome and ſpirit of Love.</p>
                        <p>And whoſoever will but vnwinde the Clew of <hi>Pauls</hi> diſputation in the whole 4. Chapter, eſpecially from verſe 21. and ſo forward to this 6. verſe of Chap. 5. ſhall I think have the ſuffrage of his own Reaſon for this interpretation. For the Apoſtle having diſputed of the bondage diſcending from <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Iſmael</hi> and his Children, from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to thoſe that held themſelves under the Covenant of Works [Doe and live] there given; and withall of the Freedom diſcending from <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeed of Chriſt then included in and typified by <hi>Iſaac, i. e.</hi> from the New and ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all true Chriſtians, concludes of all ſuch <hi>We are not the Children of the bond woman, but of the free:</hi> and in 5. Chap. verſe 1. exhorting them to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made them free;</hi> And forbidding, and in the next 3 verſes ſhewing the danger of returning againe under the ſervile yoke of the Covenant of works [Do and live] whereas by Faith and not by works, the hope of Righteouſneſs is to be expected, he concludes in the ſixth verſe, that neither circumſition nor uncircumſition, (<hi>i. e.</hi> neither workes, nor any externall priviledges of the workers) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail any thing (to life and righteouſneſſe) <hi>but Faith which worketh by love;</hi> what is that but Faith which worketh by a new principle of filiall love and not from that olde principle of ſervile feare the proper adjunct of the Covenant of workes? This is to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the free not the bond woman, by the Faith of Chriſt alone to ſeek for righteouſneſſe, yet to be ſtill working from a principle of love not of feare to bring forth fruits of ſanctification to him that hath freely juſtified us. <hi>This man ſaith the Apoſtle hath entred into
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:167891:293"/> his reſt as God hath entred into his reſt.</hi> Heb. 4. 10. <hi>As God having conſummated the worke of Creation, reſted and ceaſed from his worke, becauſe all was perfect and needed no addition; and Chriſt having offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever, ſat downe at the right hand of God, ceaſing from further ſufferings,</hi> becauſe our redemption is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and nothing more needed to bee added: Heb: 10. 12. 14. So every beeleever in reſpect of the reſt of Grace, having received by Faith the righteouſneſſe which is by this one ſacrifice of Chriſt for the purging of all his ſins, ſitteth downe for ever at reſt in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and firme tenure thereof, ceaſing from his owne workes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his juſtification becauſe it is already compleated and nothing needeth to be added to it. All his workings henceforth is to manage ſo great a ſalvation to the glory of the Author, as God worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto and Chriſt worketh, for the governing and diſpoſing to their proper ends the Creatures made, and elect men redeemed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> contrariwiſe teacheth men ſo to love themſelves as with love to deſtroy themſelves, and ſo to ſeek for life as to be ſure to loſe it; forbidding them to <hi>enter into their Reſt of Grace,</hi> and <hi>calling them back to the yoke of bondage againe,</hi> not ſuffring them to ceaſe from their owne workes, nor to <hi>doe that worke of God,</hi> Jo 6. 29. nor to act in the Sp. of love, but of feare and bondage. Is not he one of thoſe hard Taskmaſters from whoſe cruelty Chriſt calleth his Diſciples, <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> [with the yoakes and burthens which your legall Teachers impoſe on you,] <hi>and I will give you reſt?</hi> &amp;c. Theſe will never permit you to have reſt to your ſoules, Mat. 11. 28, 29.</p>
                        <p>I conclude therefore, that Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Concluſion of this his ſecond Anſwer to the Objection, is as patt to the purpoſe as an Oyſter-ſhell to a hungry appetite: and the love to our ſelves which he teacheth, to tend only to ſelfe-ruining.</p>

                        <p>In the next Chapter or Section, if wee attend onely to the ſound and roare of words, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> appeares more formidable from pag. 83. to the 98. of his Appendix, in which hee preſents us with thirteen Conſiderations, <hi>to ſhew the vanity, and intolerable damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe of this [ſuppoſed] doctrine, which he oppoſeth.</hi> But the whole ſloud of his wit, wrath, and eloquence, heere poured out together, runs into the dead Sea, by a deſart and deſolate way in which it meets with no mortall crearure to wet or hurt it. For who is there of all mankinde that hath ſaid wee ought not to act for life in the ſenſe which this man ſuborneth, or otherwiſe than I have before oft expreſſed? Much leſſe is there any profeſſed Chriſtian that hath aſſerted (as hee inſinuateth) <hi>That wee muſt not come to Chriſt that we may have life,</hi> nor <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraite gate,</hi> nor <hi>lay violant hands on the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>lay up for our ſelves a Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>ſeeke the Kingdome of God and the Righteouſneſſe the reof,</hi> nor <hi>preſſe on for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reſurrection? &amp;c.</hi> Let him be named by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that he may be brought forth and ſtoned which thus blaſphemeth, I

                        </argument>
                        <p>HEere becauſe I am to follow, and my taske is, not to leave Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> untill I have examined all that hee ſaith to prove Juſtification by works; I am neceſſitated to fall into that which will be judged a Digreſſion.</p>
                        <p>After hee hath enacted by a Law, that to ſay, wee muſt not worke for life, is a Blaſphemy, or at leaſt an intolerable errour, and to hold it practically a neceſſarily damning Doctrine, that whoſoever doth it muſt be everlaſtingly damned for it. (All which wee acknowledge to bee in ſome ſenſe true after the ſound of the words, though after the meaning of the Authour they can never be ſaved which practically hold the contrary, as poſſibly I ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhew.) Now he proceeds to indite and arraigne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation one Authour, as guilty of this damning Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> The Authour of the Book called, <hi>The Marrow of Moderne Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and many his Acceſſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> all thoſe Divines that have

                        <p>This he ſpeaketh onely in generall, we ſhall finde his particulars following. To this therefore I anſwer onely in generall;</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That it were to bee deſired that Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> had inured no more diſhonour upon thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2 And that thoſe Divines, with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelfe, could mention ſo many ſound parts in his booke, both in the matter and ends of the Author; as hee hath picked out imaginary errours in the other.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 As to the doctrine of that booke which he ſo accuſeth, I ſhall there examine in particulars where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> particularly drawes it into accuſation and judgement.</p>
                        <p>Onely by the way let me thus far excuſe my ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 I never knew who was the Author of that worke.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Neither have I read it otherwiſe than here and there a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I found it lying in my friends houſes; ſo that I could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe judge of it but <hi>ex ungue Leonem,</hi> what the whole was but by that which my ſlender judgement told me the part which I read was, not onely orthodox but ſingularly uſefull.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That I never knew there was a ſecond part of it, much leſſe ſaw it until Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> by his quotation therof ſo told me. But that ſince I have gotten both parts, yet by meanes of other imployments have not had time any further to read it but where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth it of error.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That if I knew the Author to be yet living, I ſhould have wholly left the defence of himſelfe to himſelfe. It was not ſo much the animoſity as the ingenuity of <hi>Scaliger</hi> which cauſed him when he heard that one had buſied himſelfe about the correcting of the errors in his writings, to cry out, <hi>Ego meos corrigam errores,</hi> I my ſelfe will be the corrector of my owne errors. The ſame taske may
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:167891:295"/> this Author juſtly challenge to himſelfe (if living) to be himſelfe the defender of his owne writings. Perhaps he is doing it, perhaps he hath done it, I ſhall therefore in my uncertainty what is done, onely with ſuch brevity ſeeke to diſabuſe the doubting readers of both, that I ſhall in no wiſe prevent the Authors fuller vindicating of his owne or rather Gods cauſe in his hand. Let us then attend to Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> accuſations, particularized, <hi>Append.</hi> pag. 100. and ſo onward. It was queſtioned as may be ſeen pag. 99. <hi>why he excepted againſt the Book called the Marrow of Modern Divinity?</hi> he anſwers there, <hi>becauſe it is guilty of this hainous doctrine.</hi> This he begins now pag. 100 to ſhew in particulars, alleaging firſt the words of that booke thus:</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B M. M. pag. 174. (he meanes 179)</hi> Qu. Would you not have beleevers to eſchew evill and do good, for feare of Hell or for hope of Heaven? Anſw. No indeed, I would not have any beleever to doe the one or the other, for ſo farr as they doe ſo, their obedience is but ſlaviſh &amp;c. To which end he alleageth. <hi>Lu. 1. 74. 75.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>Having thus alleaged the Author, he thus endeavours to accuſe and confute him:</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B</hi> But that ſpeaks of freedom from feare of our enemies, ſuch as Chriſt forbids <hi>Lu. 12. 5.</hi> where yet he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the fearing of God, and conſequently even that feare of enemies is forbidden, as they ſtand in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, and not as his inſtruments in ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Or if it be even a feare of God that is there meant; yet it cannot be all feare of him and his diſpleaſure: So farr as we are in danger of ſin and ſuffering, we muſt fear it: and ſo far as our aſſurance is ſtill unperfect: a jealouſie of our owne hearts and a dreadfull Reverence of God alſo are neceſſary.

                        <p n="2">2. Or hath he actually purchaſed to us ſuch a deliverance? doth not experience declare the contrary?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Or muſt we ſo long ſuſpend our ſerving of God in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and Holineſs untill we be actually delivered from all feare and danger of mens perſecutions? For ſo runs the Text as well in the originall as in our tranſlation, that the deliverance is layd as the ground of the ſervice, and that put in our poſſeſſion, before this can be put in execution, at leaſt without feare.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Is not deliverance heere the ſame thing with the ſalvation mentioned ver. 77, which Iohn was to preach? but that was ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſo is this deliverance, <hi>by the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we muſt ſerve (who are in Chriſt,) <hi>without feare of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ſees that with this evaſion he cannot decline the edge of this Scripture; therefore takes up the right interpretation of it at laſt, thus: <hi>Or if it be even a feare of God that is there meant &amp;c.</hi> Why had he not ſpoken full to the point in queſtion and ſaid <hi>the feare of Hell?</hi> This minſing will nothing help him. All that he ſaith againſt it in this ſenſe, is but ſuch as is wont to proceed from the extravagancy of an aſtoniſhed and ſelf confounded man. For who ever ſaid that a beleever muſt caſt off all feare of God and not be poſſeſſed ſtill with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:167891:296"/> a filiall feare to diſpleaſe him? <hi>Or that as farr as he is in danger of ſin and ſuffering he muſt not feare it, to ſhun it?

Let him not ſay he hath fully proved, but let him fully prove that doing and works as the Scriptures doe oppoſe the ſame to faith and receiving of Chriſt, (in which ſenſe this Author ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) are injoyned by the Goſpel to juſtification of life, or the life of juſtification, and then let him expect that his Goſpel ſhall ſtand, and the Goſpel of Chriſt lie proſtrate at his feet.</p>
                        <p>3. Becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will never bee able to prove this, the true Diſciples of Chriſt will ſtill hold this as one principle diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the two Covenants, that the one requires us to ſeeke life after the tenour of Juſtice, the other after the tenour of Grace. The one bids us to ſeeke it by Works, the other by Fayth. The one preſuppoſeth the originall righteouſneſs given us in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, bidding us by it to follow after happineſs, the other offereth Chriſt unto us as the fountain of life both of Juſtification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, calling upon us to receive or beleeve in him for both, that both may be ours when Chriſt is ours. <hi>He is our life, and when Chriſt our life</hi> (not works our life) <hi>ſhall appear, we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi> This is all that this Author meaneth in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as himſelfe makes evident.

                              <hi>B.</hi> So in his ſecond part page 190. his great note to know the voyce of the Law by, is this, That when in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is any Morall worke commanded to bee done, eyther for the eſchewing of puniſhment, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſe of any reward temporall or eternall, or elſe when any promiſe is made with the condition of any worke to bee done which is commanded in the Law, there is to bee underſtood the voyce of the Law.</p>
                           <p>A notorious and dangerous miſtake, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:167891:297"/> would make almoſt all the New Teſtament, and the very Sermons of Chriſt himſelfe, to bee nothing but the Law of works. I have fully proved before, that Morall duties as part of our ſincere obedience to Chriſt, are part of the condition of our ſalvation, and for it to be performed. And even Faith is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duty. It is pity that any Chriſtian ſhould no better know the Law from the Goſpel, eſpecially one that pretendeth to diſcover it to others.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>About the matter heer delivered by this Author, enough hath been ſpoken before, in examining what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſayd in many parts of his Aphoriſms contrary to it. Touching the proofe of the contrary Aſſertion, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſayd no more than, nor ſo much as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſayd before him, and left prepared to his hand. Hee ſhould therefore more properly have ſayd, Not I, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath fully proved, and therefore fully becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo affirmeth. As to the Aſſertor of it, why doth hee pitch upon this Author alone, when <hi>Calvin, Fulk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> (as I have before Chap. 15. alleadged and quoted them) Dr. <hi>Ameſius, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul. Theol. lib. 1. cap. 22. Se.</hi> 19. In a word all Proteſtant Divines from <hi>Luther</hi> till this preſent time, have in ſubſtance, and moſt of them that have occaſion to pitch upon the ſame Subject, have even <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> delivered the ſame doctrine, (as to mercenary, or rewards of debt) having learned the ſame from the Apoſtle, why doth he ſingle out this one as a ſingular man? Let him with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Stapleton, Maldonat,</hi> and the reſt of that hair, roar out againſt all the Reformed Churches, <hi>A notorious and dangerous miſtake &amp;c.</hi> A herd of Hereticks and ignorant Animalls; <hi>It is pity that any Chriſtian ſhould no better know the Law from the Goſpel, eſpecially ſuch as pretend to diſcover it to others.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to his <hi>Morall duties, and even Faith as a Morall duty to bee performed for ſalvation;</hi> hee ſpeaks like ſuch morall men as nature now blinded and corrupted formeth, whoſe principle it is, <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ut optimam ducem ſequi,</hi> to follow Nature and naturall inſtinct, or Reaſon as their beſt guide, knowing not ſpirituall things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Naturall man cannot receive them.</hi> If he ſavoured ſo much the Goſpel as Philoſophy, why doth not the phraſe which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles uſe [<hi>of the ſpirit and ſpirituall things</hi>] ſo much delight him as that of the Philoſophers [<hi>Morall and Moralities?</hi>] As
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:167891:298"/> much was Chriſts offering himſelfe a ſacrifice and giving ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Juſtice of God a Morall duty, and ſo not meritoricus for us, becauſe due to God from him by the Law for himſelfe: as Faith in Chriſt and other purely Goſpel duties ſubſervient unto Faith. For both theſe duties on Chriſts and on our part are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under this one generall of the Law of nature: <hi>Whatſoever I ſhall command thee thou ſhalt doe.</hi> I ſhall leave the juſtification and ſalvation by <hi>Morall Faith and Morall duties to</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and with the Apoſtle, <hi>through the Spirit wait for the hope of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by Faith.</hi> Gal. 5. 5</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> So in the next page. 191. he intelerably abuſeth the Sripture in affirming that of 2. <hi>Theſ. 2. 12.,</hi> to be the voice of the Law, and ſo making Paul a Legall preacher.</q>
                        <p>Is then every teacher, (after Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Canon) which declares what the voice, force, curſe, and condemnation of the Law is, a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Anti-Evangelicall preacher? So he affirmes Paull to bee if he ſpeake out what the curſe and condemnation of the Law is. Then not onely Paul, but Chriſt alſo and all his Apoſtles are Legall not Goſpel preachers. For he will not deny them to have ſo made out the Law in its force &amp;c. Or when the Apoſtle in that quoted Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes of their <hi>Damnation which would not believe the truth but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> doth he not leave them under the damnation of the Law for not embracing the Goſpell? doth not the Law hereby take occaſion to damne them the more deeply for neglecting and rejecting the truth? The proper office of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is not to condemn but to ſave. Onely when its ſalvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned it yeelds backe the contemners under the greater guilt to the Law to power out on them the larger, if not largeſt meaſure of its curſe and wrath. <hi>Do not thinke (ſaith our Saviour</hi> to the Iewes that rejected his Goſpell,) <hi>that I will accuſe you to the Father, there is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes in whom you truſt.</hi> Jo. 5. 45.</p>
                        <p>But whether the inference of making Paul a Legall Preacher, is to be aſcribed to Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> or to the Author of the Marrow of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divinity is eaſily diſcernible. That Author had onely ſayd that one ſentence of Paul in a whole Epiſtle was the voice of the Law. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> inferreth that ſo to ſay is to make Paul a Legall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; &amp; conſequentially that to preach any thing of the Law makes a Legall Preacher. Let now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> name one Miniſter within
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:167891:298"/> this Nation that hath taught ſuch ranke Antinomiſme, as himſelfe here that profeſſeth himſelfe an Antaegoniſt to deſtroy it. But wee may perceive by this he will be all things, as well Antinomian as Arminian and Papiſt to ſmother the truth of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> And as ſhamefully doth he abuſe <hi>1 Co. 6. 9. 10.</hi> as if the Apoſtle, when he biddeth them not to be deceived, were deceiving them himſelfe in telling them; that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſon, fornicators, adulterers, &amp;c. ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God. Is this Law? Then let me be a Preacher of the Law. If Paul be a Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt then will I be a Legalliſt too. But theſe men know not that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of thoſe that die ſuch and that theſe ſins exclude men the Kingdome as they are rebellious againſt Chriſt their Lord, and ſo a violation of the new Covenant.</q>
                        <p>How extreamly is this man in love (<hi>Narciſſus</hi> like) with his own beauty, or rather fancy? Every other Viſage not begotten of his ſeed, and faſhioned to his image is an Owle with him. The words of the Authour are theſe: [The Law ſaith], <hi>knoweſt thou not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> Be not deceived, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6. 9. <hi>And therefore thou being a ſinner and not righteous, ſhalt not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> This is all that he hath againſt which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> raiſeth his <hi>hubub,</hi> a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abuſe of the Scripture! Let him deny if hee can this to bee (though leſſe principally and ſecondarily the voice of the Goſpel, yet) primarily and more principally the voice of the Law. If not, then ſurely as he hath a Goſpel, ſo alſo hath hee a Law of his owne making. Or what other ground is there why ſuch ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdome, but becauſe they are not in Chriſt? Fer whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is baptized with the bloud of Chriſt to juſtification, is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed alſo with his ſpirit to ſanctification. And if not in Chriſt, then under the Law. If under the Law, then under the curſe and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Law; and conſequentially under the threat of the Law here denounced. Or what ſhould hinder the Apoſtle from denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the curſe of the Law againſt them that are and wilbe under the Law? Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have his will that the Goſpel condemnes them for their finall unbeliefe and rebellion againſt Chriſt: yet doth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:167891:299"/> not the Law condemne them too for all their unrighteouſneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, Adulteries, &amp;c. If he deny it, wee ſhall finde him the Author of a ſweet peece of Goſpel Doctrine: <hi>That they which are in Chriſt are under the Curſe of the Law,</hi> (ſo hath hee before ſtoutly aſſerted) but they which are enemies of Chriſt, are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it. If he confeſs it, then the ſhame returns upon himſelfe which he layes on this Author.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall examine heere firſt the Quere it ſelfe; then the amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it. The Quere or Interrogation bears the force of a ſtrong Affirmation.

                              <desc>•</desc>

But the Holy Ghoſt hath taught it. <hi>To him that worketh not but beleeveth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is imputed to him for righteouſneſſe.

So that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> loadeth not man but God with this reproach, of ſeeking to drive obedience out of the world.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether hee hath not taken up this ſlander from the Monks and Jeſuits? Whether there bee any of them that having written againſt Juſtification by Faith, which hath not aſperſed it and our Churches that hold it, with this ſcandall? Or any one of the Proteſtant Divines which hath defended this Article of our Faith, but hath ſpoken fully to the vindicating of this Doctrine from this ſo injurious a ſlander? When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſo much Popiſh that hee takes up every moſt frothy Objection of every ſhaveling of that ſide to adore it; and ſo much an Anti-Proteſtant that hee ſcorns to mention what on our part hath beene regeſted in way of anſwer to it: why takes he up his habitation among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants but to corrupt and ſeduce them?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If hee meane by the World the unbeleevers of the World, that are ſtrangers to Chriſt and the Covenant of Promiſe, how can it bee ſayd properly, this Doctrine tends to drive out obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the World? Can it drive out of the World that which is not in it? Had he ſayd, it tends to drive out the Formality, and outſide Morality, and baſe Hypocriſie from the World, wee might have conſidered of it. But to tell of driving out obedience, that which God accepteth and alloweth as true Obedience, from ſuch as would never bee drawne to it, implies a kinde of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. If there bee ſuch as turne this Doctrine into licentiouſneſs, that becauſe good works are not appointed of God to be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their juſtification, will therefore relax their diligence, the fault is not in the Doctrine, but in the corruption of their hearts. They ought to conclude from Grace to duty, and not to carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: If they do otherwiſe, it is not becauſe they have, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not effectually drank into themſelves this Doctrine. Elſe if all the means of Grace which carnall men abuſe ſhould bee guilty of their abuſe, then the death of Chriſt, and preaching of the Goſpel muſt be anathematized, becauſe he is laid as a <hi>ſtone at which ſome will ſtumble,</hi> and <hi>as well for the fall as the riſing of many in Iſrael, and that is to ſome the ſavour of death, as well as to others the ſavour of life.</hi> The children muſt not loſe their bread, for feare the doggs ſhould catch after it to ſatisfie their rapine. The Apoſtle had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a ſacred doctrine of Goſpell truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Where ſinne abounded, Grace abounded much more,</hi> Ro. 5. 20.

This uſe ſome might make of it. Doth hee therefore recall his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Nothing leſſe. Better many wretches to wantonize to their ruine, than one ſoule for which Chriſt hath died, loſe ſuch a prop of conſolation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The truly beleeving ſaints cannot ſo reaſon or abuſe the grace of God, or relax their obedience; as for other reaſons ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe alleadged by the Apoſtle, in the following part of that 6. Chapter to the Romans.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Wee doe not by the Preaching of this Doctrine open a door to prophaneneſſe, but following the guidance of the Scripture, make uſe of it as the ſtrongeſt obligation to obedience: as in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the next of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Queres ſhall be manifeſted.</p>

                        <p>Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine of juſtification by Works, is guilty of as many other crimes, ſo of this alſo wherewith hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ours.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By inſtilling into men a ſuppoſition of a poſſibility and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of attayning ſuch a righteouſneſs of their owne, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of their works, by the worth and merit whereof, they may deſerve Chriſt and juſtification by him. The ſelfe-righteous Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries will greedily ſwallow downe this bait, and then little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the obedience of faith: Will not come in to Chriſt but upon their owne Terms and Articles. For the whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian but the ſicke. Proofe enough heereof we have in the Scribes and Phariſees, who if they might not be admitted as the only ſons of God, wholly rejected the Kingdome of God. The very Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes and Harlots entring before them. Such pride is there natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in mans heart, that if they have any thing of their owne, faire though but in appearance, they thinke the Goſpel of Chriſt more credited by their profeſſion of it, than themſelves benefited by it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By blunting the edge of mens deſires after Chriſt, If it muſt be their owne works and righteouſneſs that muſt mediate their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt and juſtification by him, deſpaire of attainment ſtrikes them dead from further labouring and moving to this end. For what righteouſneſs, what works, can bee ſufficient to ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement? So obedience to the Faith is nipt in the very budde, where there is a ſenſe and conviction of a mans naughtineſs and nothingneſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By taking off the ſpirits of a Chriſtians love, joy, and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, in beleeving and ſerving, when a humble and ſelfe-denying ſoul is once choaked with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine, that all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which he hath or can have by Chriſt, is to be only a probationer for juſtification and life, even to his dying day; that till then hee is but conditionally pardoned and conditionally adopted; that Gods love to him may be anon turned into hatred, his ſinnes againe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and himſelfe hurried into hell: That his ſafety ſtill depends upon his own works &amp; righteouſnes, no peny, &amp; no <hi>Pater noſter:</hi> that the grace of God is let to farme for fine and rent; no one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the word in all this his Booke being alledged by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                           <pb n="171" facs="tcp:167891:303"/> (which I can remember) of any ſupport which the beleever ſhall receive from God in the ſtate of Grace, but all, Selfe doe, and ſelfe have: This Doctrine eyther benummeth and freezeth up all a poore Chriſtians love and delight in ſerving God, emaſculating his ſpirits to obedience: or reduceth him under a yoke of bondage, making him to worke poſſibly but in feare, not of love; as under the rod, or rather in the fire, fearing death and hell all his life time. And whether this bee (ſaving in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> accompt) obedience, or diſobedience, let them that are ſpirituall judge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. By turning the very obedience of his Diſciples into diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and rebellion. The beſt works done to be juſtified by them, and for them, are the greateſt abhomination in Gods accompt, his Grace and Salvation are either denied or refuſed when wee bring works to appropriate it to us, Rom. 4. 4, 5. what is righteouſneſſe in its matter, is ſin in its end. Therefore ſhall wee finde ſtill that whoſoever are admitted to, thoſe that ſeek to ingratiate themſelvs by their good works though done in Chriſts name, are hurled off from Chriſt. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. I know you not, depart from mee yee workers of iniquity. More joy for one ſinner that repenteth, than for ninety nine juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that need no repentance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For a more full and ſatisfactory anſwer to the Argument contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Quere, I leave the Reader to the peruſing of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines that have written upon this Subject, and abundantly refuted this calumny of the Papiſts: what I have here ſaid is rather an addition to them, then a full anſwer to the Quere, which I leave to be fetcht from them.</p>
                        <p>What he ſpeakes in the Amplification of this Quere, needeth no large examination. Firſt, he grants, <hi>That love and thankfulneſs ſhould be enough,</hi> [to hold us to obedience and duty] <hi>and will bee ſo when all our ends are attained in our ultimate end: then wee ſhall act for theſe ends no more,</hi> &amp;c. How untowardly doth this paſſage, and and another paſſage of the former Quere hang together? what he pronounceth here, that love and thankfulneſſe ſhould be enough to hold us to duty, without doing for juſtification and ſalvation, and that which here ſhould be, and hereafter ſhall be our perfection,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:167891:304"/> the ſame he affirmes there, if practiced, <hi>will undoubtedly damne the Practicer.</hi> So according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if a Chriſtian endeavour ſincerely to do what <hi>he ſhould,</hi> and to come as neere in this life as it is poſſible, to the perfection which he ſhall enjoy in the future, hee ſhall undoubtedly bee damned for it. Who then goes about to drive obedience out of the world? he, or they whom he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth?</p>
                        <p>What uſe is to be made of the affections of feare, deſire, hope, and care, to the attainment of our great ends, hath been enough diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the examination of the former Quere, and would be a meere Tautology here to do it againe.</p>
                        <p>Let it be proved once that God hath left Juſtification by workes to be a motive to obedience, it ſhall be granted to bee a help to the deſtroying of Obedience, to take downe this one Motive. But if contrariwiſe Juſtification of ſinners by Works, and Morall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience bee erected not by God, but by the Devill, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> neither Sophiſtry, nor Oratory ſhall induce us to leane upon the Devils crutch, both to the forfeiting of our Juſtification, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Obedience into ſin.</p>

                        <p>A Chip of the ſame blocke with the former, in the uſe of it Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as he hath learned of them from whom he hath received it, levels againſt the very heart of Chriſt and his Goſpell. Had hee ſaid with Iames <hi>that to ſay we have Faith and not to have workes,</hi> is to cozen our ſouls, I ſhould have ſaid with him. But in that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of a ſoul-cozening profeſſion of Faith, but layeth ſo horrid an imputation upon Faith it ſelfe, this gives us cauſe to examine what Faith he meaneth, that we may be able to diſcern whether that Faith, or elſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> by defaming it, goe about to cozen our ſouls, and ſo embrace the true friend and reject the Cheater.</p>
                        <p>This cozening Faith, according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> muſt needs bee that which ſquareth not in its nature and manner of juſtification
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:167891:305"/> with the juſtifying Faith. <hi>viz.</hi> that Goſpell Faith which (neither as a deed and worke, as a worke of Morall duty, and worke of our owne righteouſneſſe, of our perfect and meritorious righteouſneſſe, doth begin and but begin to inright us to Chriſt and juſtification by him, leaving to eyther vertues and works to perfect it: but) as an inſtrument ordeyned and given us of God, by which we receive Chriſt alone offering up himſelfe a ſacrifice for us to bee cur whole righteouſneſs to juſtification, and that without works and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to works.</p>
                        <p>That this is Pauls doctrine and Pauls juſtifying Faith, I ſuppoſe hath beene enough evinced before: and ſhall (God aſſiſting) bee more fully eleared in its due place, when I come to examine the reaſons which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> bringeth to proove his doctrine not to bee oppoſite to Pauls, but the ſame with it. Therefore in calling this Faith a ſoule couzening Faith, hee proclaimes Paul, (yea Chriſt himſelfe which revealed to Paul his Goſpel) a cheater and couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: learning this calumniation from that Jewiſh and Phariſaicall generation from which he hath derived his Doctrine.

In both theſe my hand is inſtrumentall to ſerve and furniſh me, yet by ſeverall Acts. It neither fetcheth meat from his wardrop nor clothing from his Pantry and Cellar, but by ſeveral Acts from both and either, what in both and either is laid up for me; yet ſo as all is my Lords goods, and by my pertaking thereof I am put into a capacity of dooing him faithfull and acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

                        <p>I have been the more large in expreſſing the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches upon this Argument, to wipe off the ſtain which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath learned of the Papiſts to lay upon it in this and the former quere, which are wholly framed to beguile the weaker ſort, having nothing in them to ſtagger the Judicious. And now I leave it both to the ſtrong and weak to judge, whether the Accuſer of the Brethren [himſelf] can poſſibly expreſſe more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and falſhood in ſlandering the Churches of Chriſt than this man hath done? or if he had not bound himſelf to ſpeak after the Jeſuits and Monks whatſoever they traducingly ſay, whether there be any colour of reaſon for him to have layd upon us theſe two accuſations? To hold my ſelf to that which I am now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, what is there in this Faith and Doctrine thereof, which I have deſcribed, deſerving to be called a ſoul-cozening Faith? And when he addeth, <hi>That Faith which is by many thought to juſtifie</hi> (his meaning is, which all the Proteſtant Churches and Divines teach) and which <hi>our people doe all moſt eaſily embrace, is the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt for their Saviour, and expecting pardon and ſalvation by him, but not withall receiving him for their Lord and King, nor delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up themſelves to be ruled by him.</hi> Let him now name that one Church, or one Theologiſt in any one of the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that hath ſo taught, and divided the receiving of Chriſt, as Lord and King, from receiving him as Saviour and pardoner, in juſtifying Faith: or els confeſs that he hath drunk deeply into the Jeſuits prenciples, that all equivocations, frauds, lyes, ſlanders, and whatſoever is worſe than theſe, are all not only lawfull, but alſo meritorious, when practiced for the advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:167891:308"/> concauſality with it in juſtifying: But let Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> produce one that hath divided Chriſt the King from Chriſt the Saviour, or denyed him in either Title to be the object of juſtifying Faith: or any one that hath taught that to be a juſtifying Faith, which expecteth ſalvation from Chriſt, but will not deliver up the ſoul to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him. I chalenge Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> to vindicate herein his reputation, and to manifeſt that he followeth the dictates of Naturall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at leaſt, and not of wilful malice againſt the truth, by naming one that hath taught any ſuch thing. The Proteſtant Churches and Writers are ſo cleer herein, that they do not divide from ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, the very Aſſent that there is a God, that hee made the world, that he drowned it, and repair'd it; that Chriſt was the Son of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that hee was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed at eight days old, diſputed among the Doctors, turned water into wine, and did many miracles, or whatſoever els the Scriptures in the leaſt things affirme to be true. All this the juſtifying Faith aſſents to, neither can it not aſſent to every truth of the word; yet it ſo aſſents, not as juſtifying. In this act it knows nothing but Chriſt and him crucified. Much leſſe do they ſo divide, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here againſt knowledg and conſcience object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. They ſo far ſhew themſelves abhorrent from it, that they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny any to come to the Kingdom of glory, but through Chriſts Kingdom of grace.</p>
                        <p>But the Doctrine it ſelf w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> here he reneweth about the object of Faith, Chriſt as our Lord as well as our Saviour, I have examined before in anſwer to his fourth Argument. Thither I ſend the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſatisfaction what the Proteſtants hold, and upon what grounds, here it is beſides the matter to fall into a new diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                        <p>It ſhall ſuffice here only to examine the new Argument which he brings to prove, that the Doctrine which holds forth juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, is a ſoul-cozening; but that which teacheth juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works, is a ſoul-ſaving doctrine. For this is his meaning in what he diſputeth here of Chriſt the Saviour, and Chriſt the Lord made the object of juſtifying Faith, as hee hath largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned himſelf before: And if hee mean not ſo, all that he here ſayth is but a hunting after Graſhoppers in the ſnow to fight with them: For none is there to be found oppoſing what he ſayth in the words and phraſe he uſeth. But himſelf is a ſure Interpreter of himſelfe, and we muſt take him as himſelf hath explayned his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:167891:308"/> meaning. And then his Argument is drawn from the eaſineſſe or difficulty of receiving the one or the other Doctrine. It muſt be a ſoul-cozening doctrine, which all are eaſily perſwaded to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened with. Thus wee find him expreſſing himſelf in that part of the Query which is before tranſcribed. Our people (ſaith he) do all moſt eaſily embrace it; I meet with no one but is reſolved in ſuch a faith, till it be overthrown by teaching them better. They would all truſt Chriſt for the ſaving of their ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the following part of the Querie.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B.</hi> Let any Miniſter but try his ungodly people, whether they will not all be perſwaded very eaſily to believe that Chriſt will pardon and ſave them, &amp;c. But whether it be not the hardeſt thing in the world to perſwade them really to take him for their Lord, and his word for their Law, and to endeavour faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience accordingly? Surely the eaſineſſe of the former, and difficulty of the later, ſeemeth to tell us, that it is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, excellent, neceſſary part of juſtifying Faith, to accept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly Chriſt for our Governour, and that part which the world among us will moſt hardly yeeld to, and therefore hath more need to be preached than the other.</q>
                        <p>Were he a true <hi>Iſraelite in whom there is no guile,</hi> which ſpeaketh, all this might be granted him. But becauſe he hath fully declared, that he meaneth by receiving Chriſt for our Saviour, juſtification by Faith in Chriſt the Redeemer, and by receiving him for our Lord and Governour, juſtification by works, nothing can be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted to him. The whole ſumm of his Argumentation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this ſyllogiſm:</p>
                        <p>That doctrine of Juſtification which the multitude doth eaſily embrace, is a ſoul-cozening doctrine: but that which they are not without much difficulty perſwaded to receive, is a ſoul-ſaving doctrine.</p>
                        <p>But the multitude eaſily embraceth Juſtification by Faith alone, and not without difficulty Juſtification by works:</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>He muſt acknowledge that he thus argueth, or argueth nothing, or nothing to the queſtion. To the Propoſition I diſtinguiſh firſt about the meaning of the terms: And firſt about the word <hi>embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>

For if he mean onely an externall aſſent to the verity and goodneſs of the doctrine, All men which have reaſon in their underſtandings, and freedom in their wills, do with the like facility chooſe that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is made out to them to be good, and refuſe that which is made out to them to be evill. Or if he mean a vitall and effectuall embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, the doctrine of Juſtification is alike difficult to all that are of the carnall multitude. It is a ſpirituall doctrine, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man receiveth not, cannot receive ſpirituall things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Again if he mean an eaſines and difficulty in it ſelf and to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ability, The true doctrine of Juſtification is alike difficult, yea unpoſſible to all effectually to receive. <hi>None can come to the Son except the Father draw him,</hi> Jo. 6. 44. But if he mean a facility and eaſines of receiving by means of the concurrence of Gods grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it eaſy, then is it alike eaſy to all men that are holpen alike by Gods grace; and alike difficult, yea unpoſſible to all that are left deſtitute of it. So that the eaſines or difficulty of perſwading the multitude to entertain this or that doctrine of Juſtification, can be no ſure rule of concluding either doctrine to couzen, or to ſave the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Beſides I deny the aſſumption in the whole and in both its parts. For how can that which is a ſupernaturall doctrine be eaſily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by naturall men, the whole ſtream of whoſe wiſedom and will is againſt it: ſuch as is Juſtification by Faith in the redeemed? or that which is a naturall doctrine dictated by naturall reaſon and conſcience, (I mean a doctrine of naturall right) be ſo excedent in difficulty to receive: ſuch as is Juſtification by works?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Br</hi> flies here to Experience to apologize for him. <hi>Try</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ungodly people, whether all would not, whether there be a man to be found that will not eaſily be perſwaded to beleeve that Chriſt will pardon and ſave them: But whether it be not the hardeſt thing in the world to perſwade them to take Chriſt for their Lord, and to yeeld obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,</hi>

Not to except here againſt his words in which he putteth a believing that Chriſt will pardon and ſave, for a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith: (though when he doth but dream he hath taken that advantage againſt another, as wee have ſeen, he inſults over him as over a mock-man or puppet, and can hardly abſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus to his direction, try whether all do not profeſs their Faith in Chriſt the Saviour, that they truſt and will truſt in his merits alone for ſalvation and pardon: I anſwer, Try the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly multitude whether they do not every Mothers Child pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they embrace Chriſt for their Lord, and that they do and will yeeld obedience to him to their dying day, as well as God ſhall give them grace?</p>

For if they ſo received Chriſt, they ſhould have Rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water flowing out of them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 7. 38. of carnall ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpirituall, and of unclean, holy.</p>
                        <p>Nay if experience muſt be the judge, Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> Cauſe falleth. I have tryed it, and by tryall found it the hardeſt task to perſwade the multitude to receive Chriſt Crucified alone, to their juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation. Prove the more ungodly party, ſpecially in the time of their diſtreſs, upon their death-bed, or otherwiſe when their Conſcience is awaked, and the terrors of God are upon them: Seek now to perſwade them to repoſe their affrighted ſouls upon Chriſt their Altar, to truſt in the Mediation of his blood, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe are they? they look upon Chriſt as a hard and ſtrict man, a Judge, a Law-giver, diſtributing ſtrict juſtice to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his works. And they alas have no vertue, or goodneſs, or holines, to ingratiat themſelves into his favour, but ſin enough to incenſe the very jealouſie of his fury againſt them, therefore dare not come to him becauſe they have no worth of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and works that they can plead for themſelves. Look to the more whited Phariſees, the Saints of Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> forming: how hard
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:167891:310"/> is it to perſwade them to caſt off their own righteouſnes that they may be found in Chriſt alone. They put on their own raggs firſt, and not Chriſt at all, but upon them. They thank God they have ſerved God from their youth up, have not defiled themſelves with the filth and iniquity which they have ſeen in others, have had ſuch vertues, and been full of ſuch and ſuch good works, therefore they doubt not but Chriſt will recompence them with life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But he that ſeeks to ſpoil or to perſwade them to ſpoil themſelves of the glory and power of ſuch their vertues and good works to juſtification, ſhall find it as hard a task as to wreſt the Club out of the hand of <hi>Hercules,</hi> as it is in the Proverb. Men after mine own heart ſaith Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> Be it ſo, yet that is nothing to the queſtion, except they be after Gods heart. And Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> Argument is hereby diſſolved: For it appears that it is not eaſy to perſwade the multitude to receive Chriſt alone to ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>But whether his chief ſcope in this his reaſoning, be not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the Proteſtant Churches of levity and impiety, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Rome</hi> ſo eaſily in thouſands and ten thouſands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſo many Nations, and within ſo few years, by the lure of this Libertine and ſoul-cozening doctrine (as he terms it) I leave it to his own Conſcience to judge. This himſelf makes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in the Articles of grace and juſtification, he holds it a damnable ſchiſm in us ſo to have divorced our ſelves from <hi>Rome,</hi> and applyeth himſelf with all his ſtrength, to make up the breach, and bring us back again.</p>
                        <p>The reſt which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath interſerted, and which followeth in this Quere, is light and ridiculous, prepared for the gulling of light and ridiculous men, altogether beneath the weight and depth which is in Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> and which he uſeth when he deals with men like himſelf, ſolid and ſerious, at leaſt in naturall and morall knowledg, ſuch is that which he hath, <hi>p.</hi> 327.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 Whether they which receive Chriſt crucified do not receive whole Chriſt? <hi>Chriſt which by the eternall ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.

There was his divine nature, <hi>the Eternall Spirit offering,</hi> the humane nature <hi>himſelf offered,</hi> and the ſame in the integrity and purity of its celeſtiall endowments: <hi>Without ſpot; if this be but half</hi> Chriſt, which is the other half?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Or becauſe he underſtands by whole Chriſt, Chriſt in the fruits of all his offices, (as is moſt probable) whether he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to receive whole Chriſt, which apply not all the ſeverall Acts and Fruits of his ſeverall offices to one and the ſame end, but to ſeverall ends to which his wiſedom hath appropriated them. Suppoſe a ſon of ſome <hi>Luke,</hi> that is a Phyſician, a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and a Father in his Family. If the ſayd ſon ſhall make uſe of the Acts and Fruits of all theſe Offices of his Father, not at all to one end, but to the ſeverall ends to which they are proper; of his Art and Phyſick to cure his diſeaſed body, of his Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrine to illuminate his underſtanding, and heal his wounded ſoul, and of his proviſion of victuals to preſerve his life, and nouriſh his body: and not of phyſick, word and bread together, for one and the ſame the nutriment of his body, ſhall this man therefore be ſaid not to own and receive his whole Father, but half of him? Even ſo the Offices of Chriſt are various, and his actings in them tend to various ends, ſome to our quickning, ſom to our enlightning, ſome to our juſtification, ſome to our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do I take but half Chriſt, becauſe I apply not all the Actings and Fruits of all his Offices to my Juſtification only, and none of them to the other honourable ends to which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them? who can bear the abſurdity?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Whether it be poſſible for any man (according to the rule and tenor of the Goſpel) by a lively faith to apply to himſelf the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death, and yet to remain unpardoned and unjuſtified? or for ſuch a one to abide unſpiritualliz'd and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nctfied? If not, then the reaſon why the multitude w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> profes they truſt Chriſt for the ſaving of their ſouls (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B. is pleaſd to phraſe it) do remain unjuſtified, is becauſe they profeſſ, but have not a

                           <hi>B.</hi> Though ſome thinke nothing is preaching Chriſt, but preaching him as a pardoning juſtifying Saviour. Indeed among the Turks and Indians that entertain not the Goſpell, it is neceſſary to preach his pardoning office, yea and the verity of his Natures and Commiſſion: Therefore when the Apoſtles preached to Jews and Pagans, they did firſt and chiefly teach them the perſon and offices of Chriſt, and the great benefits which they might receive by him. But when they preach (as James) to be profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, they chiefly urge them to ſtrive to enter, to fight that they may conquer, to run that they may obtain, to lay violent hands upon the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>Either all this relates to Juſtification, or it is meer babble in the Ayr, ſound without ſenſe or ſubſtance, as much to his purpoſe as was his that trudged about all the Town from ſhop to ſhop to buy two penny-worth of <hi>Circumſtance</hi> for the cure of his tooth-ach. For his quere is, whether our Doctrine which teacheth Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith without works, do not confirm men in their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cozening Faith. If all doth relate to juſtification, then let him that can find, help me, without help I cannot find as much as a grain of reaſon in all or any part of it, ſuch reaſon at leaſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> who grounds all his Religion upon reaſon.</p>
                        <p>To the firſt Clauſe I ſtand ſtupified, not knowing how to preach Chriſt to juſtification, but as Chriſt the Juſtifier; to pardon, but as Chriſt the pardoner; or to ſalvation, but as Chriſt the Saviour. Should I preach him as a condemner to juſtification, as an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Judg to ſalvation? As to his juſtifying me as he is a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, either there hath been wanting ſomething in Mr. B. dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriry of teaching, or in my docility to apprehend, I am yet to be taught this leſſon. All that he hath ſaid hitherto, hath made it but odious and abſurd, and here hee ſaith no more to perfect it.</p>
                        <p>To that which follows, the abſurdity of it doth enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:167891:311"/> it ſelf. Who can endure to hear that the Apoſtles when they preached to Jewes and Pagans did; and we, if we ſhould be ſent to preach to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> muſt firſt preach Chriſt alone to juſtification, and ſo generate in them a ſoul-ct zening faith: But when once they become profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, then the Apoſtles did, and we muſt teach them better, urging them no longer to cozen their ſouls with faith in Chriſt the Saviour, but by their own works to juſtifie and ſave themſelves. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſuch a Goſpel, let him be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> diſciple.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems he is angry with <hi>James</hi> for not helping him erewhile in his great exigency, that he ſingles out him from all the Apoſtles, to father him with this intolerable doctrine. But whether <hi>James</hi> give him herein any relief, hath been before examined.</p>
                        <p>As for the reſt of the Apoſtles, let <hi>Paul</hi> give the Teſtimony for himſelf and them. <hi>There is one Lord and Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one Lord and Father of all,</hi> Ephe. 4. 5. 1 Tim 2. 5. Not two Chriſts, and two Faiths, one to cozen at firſt, and the other to ſave the ſoul afterward. <hi>If Paul or an Angell from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould preach any other Goſpell then what you have heard</hi> [from me at firſt while Pagans] <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. Therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galathians</hi> had been profeſſors of the Chriſtian faith, he ſeeks to root them faſt by faith alone in Chriſt, and not to ſtart from their firſt principles; reducing ſuch as went a whoring after works to help faith in juſtifying them, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them accurſed, and Apoſtates from Chriſt, that ſhould ſo fall off from their firſt liberty in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>That all obedience, yea faith in Chriſt to all obedience, vertue and good works is to be preached and urged upon them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Chriſtian faith, is ſo true, that he is but a maimed preacher of Chriſt that doth it not, but all to ſanctification, not to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the true Preacher of Chriſt that preacheth Chriſt to good works, not works to win Chriſt, that ſeeks to bring us into <hi>Marriage-union with Chriſt, that we may bring forth fruit to God,</hi> Rom. 7. 4. Not that we ſhould bring forth baſtard-fruit from another, that we may be married to Chriſt. But this is not Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſpeaks of fruit to juſtification.</p>
                        <p>To conclude what I have to ſay to this Quere, It is his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that teacheth a ſoul-cozening Faith, a Faith made up of a fardle of works and rags of our own righteouſneſs, as in his larger definition of juſtifying Faith he hath deſcribed it.</p>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> calumnie, that this doctrine doth harden the Papiſts in their Popery, and give occaſion to many learned Proteſtants to turn Papiſts, anſwered.</p>

                        <p>HIS fifth Quere hath no ſhew of weight in it, deſerving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, ſavouring more of the Spleen than of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Author. Nevertheleſs, though it declares only the ſtomach and indignation of the man againſt the truth, rather then any ſtrength in his hand to hurt it: yet becauſe it is formed for the deceiving of the ſimple and unwary, upon whom ſounds oft times take no leſs impreſſion than actuall ſtrokes; to prevent damage to ſuch I ſhall examine whatſoever may ſeem materiall in it, as I have the reſt.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B. pa. 329.</hi> 5. Laſtly, Is not this excluding of ſincere Obedience from Juſtification, the great ſtumbling-block of Papiſts? and that which hath had a great hand in turning many learned men from the true Proteſtant Religion to Popery?</q>
                        <p>That by obedience he meaneth all morall qualifications and works as they are vertues and works, we have before learned from his own words: ſo his meaning is, that the Doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Churches which follow him, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification by Faith, and not by works, is guilty of the damnable and pernicious evills which he here chargeth upon it. Theſe evills are two.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is the great ſtumbling-block of the Papiſts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It hath carried back many learned men from the Proteſtant Religion to Popery. To both theſe I ſhall ſpeak in order. 1 Of its hardning the Papiſts in Popery.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Is it not the great ſtumbling-block to Papiſts?</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Br.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>I anſwer, 1 <hi>Was not Chriſt</hi> (and that in this very point of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ungodly by an imputed righteouſneſs, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſs of their own) <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to the Jewes;</hi> as which they were ſo offended, that to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ruine, they reject the Goſpel and ſalvation of Chriſt unto this day? <hi>Rom. 9. 32, 33. 1 Cor. 1. 23. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 8. What then? muſt Chriſt be anathematized? Nay, but let the truth of Chriſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:167891:312"/> ſtand, and man be the lyar, the tranſgreſſor: It is <hi>ſcandalum, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non datum,</hi> an offence taken, not given: And <hi>bleſſed is he who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall not be offended in [or at] Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 11. 6. Lu. 7. 23. But if any will be offended, and daſh, the Lord Chriſt admoniſheth him of the danger: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone ſhall be broken; but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder,</hi> Mat. 21. 44.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 And as ſound a reaſon is it that our doctrine of Juſtification hinders the Papiſts from turning Proteſtants, as was that of ſome Statiſts that complained againſt the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that they hindered the converſion of Papiſts in thoſe parts, by forbidding dancing; and the like grave conſideration by ſome great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in <hi>England,</hi> that the forbearing of Bull and Bear-baiting, and other ſports on the Lords day, hardned the Papiſts of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> in their Popery. When Religion is made a meer piece of policy, and to have in it at the beſt no more than a dreſs of dreggiſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality or morality, no marvail if ſuch dirty and unſpirituall means are made uſe of to ſpread it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But how deep doth this effect lurk in its cauſe, ſo that only this one mans ſagacity can ſmell it out? That the Papiſts in the leaſt things will not turn Proteſtants, except we in the worſt turn Papiſts. For this Article of Juſtification is the greateſt of all the queſtions controverted between us and the Papiſts. All the reſt not ingredients of, or meerly relating to this, may the Papiſts continue in (if not of malice or wilfulneſſe) with a poſſibility of ſalvation. They are but wood, hay, and ſtubble built upon the foundation, the very builders whereof may be ſaved, <hi>but ſo as by fire,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. But a Trentified Papiſt, by the coherent judgment of the beſt Divines, cannot be ſaved, becauſe hee hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the foundation ſure and pure, but mixeth mans works with the grace of God in Chriſt to Juſtification. And their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is grounded upon the authority of the Apoſtle: <hi>Yee are faln from grace, Chriſt is become void [or forfeyted] to you, whoſoever are juſtified by works.</hi> An ardent love to <hi>Romes</hi> ſhavelings out of doubt poſſeſſeth Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> that he doth not only wiſh himſelf (as did the Apoſtle) but would make himſelf and all us accurſed, that they might be (not ſaved, but) damned with us. For if they reject all other their errors, and practically retain but this one, by it they forfeyt all the ſalvation of the Goſpel.</p>

I know not any one profeſſed Proteſtant that hath aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:167891:315"/> him for any thing that in all that time of ſo long a life, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed or omitted, as unworthy of a learned and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of Chriſt, until the candor of M. Br. hath now done it. Truth it is, that <hi>George Major</hi> in his time, about a hundred years ſithence, when <hi>Luther</hi> was dead (not daring ſo to do while he was living) ſet forth ſome propoſitions and diſputations of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of good works to ſalvation; and finding himſelf quickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, he after more fully explained himſelf, or rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make his Doctrine the more ſmooth to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by allaying it thus: That we are juſtified by faith only, but not ſaved without works. So that good works are neceſſary though not to juſtification, yet to ſalvation. At this his Doctrine, as all the Churches and their Miniſters were much offended, ſo were there many that confuted it; among others <hi>Strigelius, Wigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> &amp; this <hi>Amſdorfius,</hi> who wrote againſt him his <hi>Bona opera officiunt ſaluti:</hi> Good works are hinderances of ſalvation. A propoſition I acknowledg not well ſounding in words; but the ſubſtance of Treatiſes is not to be judged alway from their Titles; This work of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath a golden Title, <hi>Aphoriſms of Juſtification:</hi> untill a man hath read the Book, he would have ſuppoſed from the Title, they had bin Aphoriſms to maintain, not to deſtroy Juſtification by free grace. So on the other ſide the Paradoxical ſound of <hi>Amſdorfius</hi> his titular poſition, doth in no wiſe deny his Treatiſe thereon to be orthodox, except Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> can produce any thing thence to prove that he affirms good works in themſelves to be ſo, and not only in the ſenſe wherein <hi>George Major</hi> affirms them neceſſary to ſalvation. Or why this Aſſereion ſtifly maintained by <hi>George Major,</hi> ſhould not be counted a hereſie in him as well as in the Papiſts, or the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees before them, I ſee no other reaſon but this, that then Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> having more worthily deſerv'd than he, will be thought fit to be honoured with the Title of Doctor in the ſame profeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To that of <hi>Melchior Adamus,</hi> I ſay no more, but that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an Adverſary without proofes is unworthy, or at leaſt incompetent to bow our belief to it. What wreſting and curtila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there is of their ſentences, whom in this caſe ſuch men would defame, is obvious to every mans notice. He ſhould in ſtead of his <hi>Individuum vagum, his quidam,</hi> have named ſome ſingular perſons, &amp; at leaſt have quoted ſome of their writings, in which they have propugned ſuch aſſertions, that we might have ſearched and found whether it were ſo, if he would have been believed. Otherwiſe, if theſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:167891:316"/> things were only for diſputations-ſake handled in the Schools, this argues not the propugners to be of that judgment.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 What he ſaith of <hi>Melancton</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> whether it be true or falſe, is of the like moment. Be it that ſome crazie brains, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding ſonns of <hi>Momus</hi> (with whom the world too much at all times aboundeth) envied becauſe they could not match, and ſought to defame, becauſe they envied the excellent parts of theſe two Worthies, was either of them ſo wiſe and learned, as to run headlong from Chriſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon it? Nay, this is a piece of learning which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> &amp; his <hi>Grotius</hi> have of very late yeers learned and taught. The true ſervants of Chriſt in former times were ſo little ſcholaſticall, that they were ignorant in this Art. Yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Melancton</hi> after the death of <hi>Luther</hi> gave not ſome occaſion to the Proteſtant Churches to mourn till this day for the yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruits of his timorouſneſs, or (as Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> will have us call it) moderation, I leave to the wiſe who are acquainted with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of thoſe times, to judg. But I never underſtood any ſuch thing imputed to <hi>Bucer,</hi> or that he hath left any other but a ſweet ſavour behind him. Nor any thing that can ſo dim the worth of <hi>Melancton,</hi> that his name ſhould not be in continuall veneration among the Saints: For who can ſay he is without his infirmities? But in the point of Juſtification by Faith only, he was ſound till death.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 But what hee ſaith of the <hi>Antimonian</hi> Teachers what they preach at preſent, and yet are magnified for the only preachers of Free Grace, is that which ſtartles Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> and makes him run ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny furlongs beyond <hi>Grotius.</hi> If his haſt had not put him out of breath, he might have told us what places of <hi>England</hi> are haunted with theſe Spirits, that we might have ſhunned them.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> laſt Argument drawn from the Teſtimony of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny approved Authors Examined and Anſwered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HIs laſt Argument is drawn from the teſtimony and authority of many eminent Divines in the Proteſtant Churches, which he ſaith have taught and publiſhed this doctrine before him. This Argument is principally urged not in the Aphoriſms, but the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix. And although Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> tell us, <hi>App.</hi> p. 111. that he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them (not to confirm his doctrine, but) to ſhew that he is not ſingular, but hath the concurrent judgments of others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And <hi>App.</hi> p. 167. &amp; 188. that he doth it to ſatisfie them which charge him with ſingularity, not as an appeal to man: Yet it is too evident that his purpoſe herein is to abuſe the leſs knowing and conſidering part of his Readers with this more then with the moſt of his other Arguments. Great names he knowes doe make deep impreſſions upon the fancies of men that have much of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but little of judgment. And that theſe look not ſo much to the matter as to the men. Could they think Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath here ſaid no more then theſe and theſe confeſſedly pious and learned Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies have ſaid before him, they will take him for a blaſphemer that ſhall ſay againſt him. Therefore he muſters together ſo many choyce veſſels and pretious ſervants of Chriſt, truſting to the ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imbecility or credulity of his vulgar Readers, that either they cannot or will not examin and compare theſe and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then Mr. <hi>Br</hi> ſhall be taken to be of the ſame ſpirit with Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe, Calvin, Pareus, Perkins,</hi> and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Divines whom he alleageth, and then alſo it muſt be all truth that he hath ſaid, after ſuch men, and whoſoever ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:167891:317"/> him muſt be brought forth to be ſtoned.</p>
                        <p>But where is the mans ſincerity that will be juſtified by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſincerity of his obedience and works? Was it not wholly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from him, when he cited theſe men as concurring in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him, when he knowes them all to deteſt his aſſertions againſt which we except, more then death it ſelf, and that many of them have jeoparded, and ſome of them laid down their lives and blood to give teſtimony to the contrary Aſſertions? Or will Mr. <hi>B.</hi> name any one of theſe at whoſe judgment his doctrine ſhall ſtand or fall, as true or erroneous? Why doth he thus abuſe the ſimple, thereby diſcovering his impudent fallaciouſneſs to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, with whom elſwhere he ſeeks chiefly to ingratiat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? But come we to the Teſtimonies which he alleageth.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax. 1</hi> Mr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Faith is an accepting of Chriſt offered, rather then a beleeving of a Propoſition affirmed? <hi>App. p. 111.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>Who hath denied this? Or what is this to Juſtification by works? It may poſsibly be ſomething to the Queſtion not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately there propoſed; but nothing at all liſting with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, to which all the reſt which he delivers are but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives.</p>
                        <p>Next to Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> he alledgeth Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> at the end of the ſame page. The ſix firſt Poſitions wherein he affirms him to ſpeak the ſame thing with himſelf, I ſee no ſound reaſon why any ſhould except againſt. But if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or an Angel from heaven ſhall deduce erratick and erroneous Concluſions from thoſe Premiſſes, they are not to be heard, but reſiſted at the face. None of the worſt Hereticks but agree in ſome principles with the moſt Orthodox, yet this nothing hinders but that the aſſertions in which they diſſent may be altogether pernicious.</p>
                        <p>How far and how unanimouſly all the Proteſtant Churches maintain the ſeventh point wherein Mr. B. affirms this pious and learned Doctor to agree with him, hath been before fully expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in the examination of the fourth Argument. So that it is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs here to run over ſo many paſſages of the Author, from <hi>p.</hi> 112. to <hi>p.</hi> 117. of the Appendix, to declare that this one man ſaith what all the reſt ſay and hold with him, <hi>viz.</hi> That juſtifying Faith is an accepting of Chriſt as Lord and Saviour. But what is this to the ſubſtance of the queſtion to which Mr. B. anſwereth?</p>
                        <p>Where it is objected to Mr. <hi>Br Qu.</hi> 14. that he ſo layeth this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that he may thereby lay a ground-work for Juſtification
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:167891:317"/> by works? Doth Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> to this end make Chriſt as Lord the object of Juſtifying Faith? or any where affirm him to be offered as a Law-giver or Commander of morall works and duties, to our juſtifying? Much leſs doth he affirm that ſuch works have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to do with Faith in juſtifying.</p>
                        <p>A notable skill hath Mr. <hi>Br</hi> in confounding when he ſhould divide and diſtinguiſh, and in diſtinguiſhing when there is no need; as either may ſerve to his purpoſe. He knowes that Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> when he treats of the New Covenant, comprehends under it the whole doctrine and all the Promiſes of Grace made <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt; as the ſame Chriſt is given to us not onely to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo to regeneration, illumination, ſanctification, and whatſoever the Grace of the Eternall Father hath made him to us. And when he treats of Faith, he handles it as the inſtrument by which not onely Juſtification, but alſo all the other benefits of Chriſt may be made ours, in receiving Chriſt the treaſury &amp; ſpring of all appropriated to us. Therefore in deſcribing the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he deſcribes it in generall as the womb of all the bleſſings which are attainable by Chriſt, and not of Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone. And in deſcribing Faith he deſcribes it as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which we apprehend and appropriate to our ſelves, not onely Chriſt as righteouſneſs and ſalvation, but alſo as wiſedome and ſanctification, yea all that tends to the perfecting of a poor ſinner, to our ſelves. Therefore is it that he ſpeaks more largely of the Covenant, and treats more fully of it then needed, if he had been to ſpeak of it onely to Juſtification and Bleſſedneſs: and that he ſpeaks of Faith more largely, and mentioneth other acts of it then are required to this one end: And neceſſarily muſt he ſo do, elſe ſhould he have maimed both the Covenant of Grace, and the Faith of Chriſt. Here whatſoever Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſpeaketh of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Faith in generall, of which ſome part belongeth to the intereſſing of us to ſanctification and other bleſſings which are by Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Br</hi> to beguile his Reader, confoundeth and confineth to Juſtification, as being ſpoken of it alone. When contrariwiſe the Doctor doth enough cleerly expreſs the diſtinct benefits of the Covenant, and the diſtinct acts of Faith receiving the diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; in the very words which he alledgeth out of him, <hi>App. p. 117. Thou ſhalt receive the gift of Righteouſneſs wrought by him, for an abſolution for thy ſins, and for a reconciliation with me:</hi> [This is our Juſtification] <hi>And thereupon thou ſhalt grow up in love and obedience
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:167891:318"/> towards me</hi> [This is our ſanctification.]</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſe he ſhould have affirmed that Faith, as it cleaveth to Chriſt, not onely for the ſprinkling of his blood for Juſtification, but withall for the effuſion of his ſpirit to ſanctification, and the ſhedding forth of his beams for illumination, and the ſtretching forth of his Almighty arm for ſupportation, &amp;c. doth in all theſe acts juſtifie: as ſome Divines do ſeem to ſpeak, though (without prejudice to their reputation) not enough adviſedly: yet both he and they are ſo far from making either the moſt ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedom, which are the immediate fruits of illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or love, righteouſnes, and holines, and their acts or works which are the immediate fruits of ſanctification, to be in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect uſefull to juſtification; that they utterly deny, peace, joy, and hope, the immediate fruits of Juſtification, to be any way ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and uſefull in this buſineſs. But I find not Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> any where laying that ground-work, much leſs erecting ſuch a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it.</p>
                        <p>To the five laſt points if Mr. <hi>Br</hi> hold them in that which I have expreſſed to be Dr. <hi>Preſtons</hi> ſenſe, yea which himſelf expreſſeth to be his own ſenſe, I have nothing to ſay againſt him. The tenth onely excepted, to which I muſt be alſo mute, becauſe neither doth Mr. <hi>Br</hi> alledg what the Doctor ſaith, and I have not that Treatiſe of his to inform me.</p>
                        <p>But all this is but a playing with holy things, he might as well have ſaid Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> conſents with him in confeſſing there is a God, a Chriſt, a Juſtification, a man, a ſinner to be juſtified, as have ſaid moſt of what he hath here ſaid. We expected he ſhould have produced teſtimonies of other Divines ſpeaking in common with him, what he ſpeaks in common with the Papiſts, in oppoſition to the doctrine of the Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>In his Appendix, <hi>p.</hi> 167. and thenceforth to the end of the Book, he brings a new ſupply of Teſtimonies, which he intituleth</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> Sayings of excellent Divines; added to ſatisfie you who charge me with ſingularity.</q>
                        <p>I ſhall examine ſo many of them as have any ſhew of agreement with Mr. <hi>Br</hi> in thoſe things wherein he fights againſt the doctrine of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>

What one of our Church will maintaine that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one obteins actuall Redemption by Chriſt without Faith? eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:167891:318"/> conſidering that redemption by the blood of Chriſt, and forgiveneſſe of ſins are all one. <hi>Eph. 1. 17. Col. 1. 14.</hi>

                        <p>How prettily would he here inſtill into the thought of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> is a man of levity, here a ſubverter of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm, whereof in his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> p. 173. he complained him to be a Pillarer? that here he ſubverteth Juſtification from eternity, whereof elſwhere he is an aſſertor? Nay here he ſpeaketh of the Juſtification which is by vertue of the New Covenant, of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of it actually to our ſelves.

                              <hi>His meaning in my judgment is onely this, that Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for the imperfection of our faith and holineſs, although we continue therein untill death: But he hath not made ſatisfaction for the contempts and hatred of his word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in caſe men do continue therein unto death.</hi>

                        <p>Here is nothing of that which Mr. B. hunts after, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for no offence, no infirmity committed againſt the New Covenant, but this alone is the ſum of it, that they ſhall have no benefit by Chriſt, no one ſin committed againſt the Law or Goſpel pardoned to them, who live and dye impenitent and unbelievers. According to that of our Saviour, <hi>Jo. 8. 24. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid unto you ye ſhall dye in your ſins, for if ye beleeve not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi>

                        <p>1 In how different a ſenſe from Mr. B. the Proteſtants take the word Condition hath been before expreſſed. 2 But in that ſenſe in which they [that uſe it] take it, it is one thing to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the New Covenant, another to be the condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is but one of many benefits of the Covenant of Grace. Had <hi>Alſteed</hi> in the Explication of himſelf affirmed holineſs of life a condition of juſtification, we ſhould have had it at the full from Mr. B.</p>

                        <p>To what purpoſe he here produceth the Teſtimony of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Doctor, except it be to declare his conſent with himſelf and <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the Law is not abrogated but relaxed onely, by means of Chriſts mediation; I know not. If ſo <hi>Rivet</hi> hath nothing for him, but much directly againſt him. 1 He affirms what no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall man ever denied, that the Grace of God is free and not bound. How elſe ſhould it be Grace? 2 Yea it is free not onely from Co-action, but from abſolute neceſſity alſo. Onely the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God being preſuppoſed, that he would ſo ſave by grace as that no one title of his juſtice ſhould fall, it was neceſſary there ſhould be the interceding of a Covenant and a Mediator. But is this to any other purpoſe then what he concludes with, <hi>viz. [to fill up the vacant pages,</hi> p. 188.] 3 That there muſt alſo an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant to this end paſs between the Father and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But when this Covenant is ratified, ſo that Chriſt becomes the undertaker, and God the accepter of ſatisfaction in relation to them for whom the ſatisfaction is made, ſo that the penalty of the Law as to their ſins,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:167891:319"/> is transferred upon Chriſt: whether the Law be not ſo abrogate to them, that they are no longer under the Curſe of it, is the thing in queſtion. And here Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> gives his verdit for us againſt <hi>Mr.</hi> B. That to theſe the Law is abrogate, and God no more ſtands in the relation of a party offended againſt them. What more proper ſword-man could he have brought forth to have hewn in pieces his own Cauſe?</p>

                        <p>What doth he mean by citing the Teſtimony of this Doctor ſo frequently, and catching fragments from him, whom he knows in the whole bulk of his works to deſtroy what himſelf would ſet up? yea though he complains againſt him for erecting the main pillar of Antinomianiſm, will he at length become his Diſciple and build pillars with him. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> doth enough waſh his hands from Mr. <hi>Br</hi> doctrine, even in theſe paſſages here cited from him, as I could fully manifeſt. But becauſe I ſee the task would be tedious to examine particularly every particular teſtimony which he citeth: The ſame perſons ſpeaking in ſeverall of the quoted places the ſame thing, and many ſpeaking no more then one at once hath ſaid before: I ſhall therefore abridge my ſelf, in ſhewing in generall the diſſenting judgment of thoſe writers from him, however he would deceive his Reader with a credulous opinion that they conſent with him. This will be done with an eaſie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: when contrariwiſe to ſpeak ſingularly to every ſingular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, would not yeeld forth fruit worthy the labour.</p>

Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> of Juſtification, <hi>p.</hi> 187. are here compiled to tell them that are no friends to the doctrine of grace, (though it alone muſt befriend them if they will be ſaved) that all theſe Divines conſent with him in his doctrine, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>To manifeſt how faithfull he is in theſe his allegations, I ſhall briefly expreſs what the judgment of all Proteſtants is about theſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:167891:320"/> points, that the adviſed Reader may judge whether theſe diſſent from the reſt and prepared the way for Mr. <hi>Br</hi> to proſecute his Aſſertions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They grant that the promulgation of righteouſnes &amp; life is to be made univerſally &amp; conditionally to all. <hi>God knoweth who are his,</hi> but the Heralds of his grace know not.

                        <p n="2">2 They are wont oft to uſe the word ſalvation (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo doth) for glorification hereafter: and ſo take it as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from juſtification: and involve into the condition of ſalvation more then into the condition of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 By the word Condition they underſtand oft all the neceſſary antecedents, and ſometimes alſo the neceſſary conſequents either of juſtification or ſalvation. But ſo as they term ſuch Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents the conditions, without which going before thoſe ends can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained, and thoſe Conſequents the conditions without which following we cannot attain the certain knowledge that we are juſtified and inrighted to glory.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That as oft as they ſpeak of conditions of juſtification, they mean the juſtification of the New Covenant, not the juſtification immanent in God, or that which Mr. B. calleth Chriſts own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as the publick perſon, <hi>Aph.</hi> p. 195.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 They utterly deny morall obedience and good works to be in any other ſenſe a condition of juſtification, but as it is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof to evidence it. Mr. B. indeed, as if he had not enough injured Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> by making him in ſome kind a Patron of his Whimſies, in prefixing his name to this his Book, Dedicating it to him as above others an eminent Fautor of ſuch doctrines; would willingly here alſo draw him <hi>quaſi obtorto collo,</hi> to be the Founder of this his Jeſuiticall error, as he makes him out, <hi>App. p.</hi> 187, 188. But I have before ſhew'd that the preaching of repentance and the preaching of Faith for the remiſſion of ſins, are in Goſpel language one and the ſame thing.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:167891:322"/> his Conſcience ſeems to hold him bound from ſaying any thing manifeſtly againſt the truth. Mr. B. may poſſibly tickle himſelf with his words, but his matter duly pondered gives him a ſting ſufficient to perſwade him to forbear laughter. Let the unbiaſſed judicious Reader, add conſideration to his reading and then judge.</p>
                        <p>The reſt of the teſtimonies which he hath here cited and quoted I let paſſe as altogether beſides the queſtions which Mr. B. hath ſet in agitation between himſelf and all the Proteſtant-Churches.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Come now to the moſt accurate, fineſt, and chiefeſt part of Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> Art, his Alcumiſtry, by which hee turneth the baſeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals into gold, darkneſs into light, death into life, deformity into beauty, and hell into heaven it ſelf. All this he with ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours labours to accompliſh, while with ſtrong confidence hee goes about to vindicate his doctrine from all error, all infection of Popery, <hi>Socinianiſm, Phariſaiſm,</hi> and to render it the ſame with the doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> and of Chriſt, guiltleſs of all derogation to the praiſe of Gods grace, Chriſts merits, or the Saints comfort; Yea to ſet it forth in ſuch a ſplendor, that although hee hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deſcribed ſuch a grace of God, as by his donation was no more appropriated and peculiarized to <hi>Peter</hi> then to <hi>Judas,</hi> to the curſed in hell, than to the Saints in heaven: and ſuch a Chriſt as reigneth Tyrant-like in the Kingdom of grace, chaining up his own, all his own ſubjects and friends, under the curſe of the Law to bear the horrors and torments of it in ſoul and body all their life, yea after death as long as the world ſhall continue: though he hath taken away from the Saints (after their ſelf-denyall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, building themſelves by their moſt holy Faith upon Chriſt the Rock, after their renovation and ſanctification by the Spirit) all hope and poſſibility of attaining any aſſurance of Gods unchangeable love to them, or of their ſinns irrevocably pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or of their perſeverance in the ſtate of Grace, or of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defeazable right to glory, or of their exemption from the curſe and wrath of God while they live, or of the reſt and freedom of their ſouls after death, either from the flames of Hell, or of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory as long as the world ſtandeth: After hee hath taught that no man ſhall have any part in Chriſt and his benefits, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth it not by his own righteouſneſs, his own perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſ [<hi>in ſuo genere</hi>] yea by the merits of his righteouſneſs: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he hath proclaimed that his Goſpel brings no better ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of joy than theſe: Yet at length hee comes to varniſh over ſuch a Grace, ſuch a Chriſt, ſuch a Goſpel, ſuch a ſtate of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:167891:323"/> (who are all of his own faigning) with ſuch paints and fine colours, as by them to enamour all men to embrace theſe as the only true and appetible Grace, Chriſt, Goſpel, and ſtate of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. That this Doctrine is as ſmooth as <hi>Eſau's</hi> hands, as free from Popery, Socinianiſm, from all injurie againſt the grace of God, all-ſufficiency of Chriſts merits, conſolation of the Saints, yea from all error whatſoever, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was from ſores, or the poor <hi>Gadaren</hi> from Devills, that had but a legion of them within him: That it agrees ſo harmoniouſly with the doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> as light with darkneſſ, Chriſt with <hi>Belial,</hi> and the Temple of God with Idols: That in theſe things the Covenant of Grace conſiſteth indeed, therefore invites all at the conſideration of the innocency and profundity of this his Goſpel, to follow him in ſeeking a ſure ſalvation by their own righteouſneſs in the Curſe of the Law.</p>
                        <p>To inſiſt no longer upon generals, I ſhall examine the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Apologies which he makes for this his Doctrine of Juſtification by works, to cleer it from the falſe imputations which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Antinomians</hi> that is (in his Conſtruction) <hi>Luther, Calvin, Twiſſe, Pemble,</hi> and their followers might charge it withall.</p>
                        <p>His firſt Task which he appoints to himſelf, is to vindicate it from having any ſmack of Popery; how ſo? doth not both he and they maintain in the ſame words that we are juſtified by works? this he cannot deny. But forſooth there is a great difference in this, whoſe pen it is that drops the aſſertion. The Papiſts do it with a quill of a Capitoline, Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> with a quill of a <hi>Kederminſter</hi> gooſe. This alters the caſe ſaith <hi>Ploydon,</hi> &amp; makes the ſame Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be Popery and no Popery. But let us hear himſelf ſpeaking, and multiplying his reaſons why it muſt not be taken for Popery.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Br.</hi> Aphor. <hi>p. 304, 305.</hi> How this differeth from the Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I need not tell any Scholar that hath read their writings. 1 They take juſtifying for ſanctifying, ſo do not I. 2 They quite overthrow and deny the moſt reall difference between the Old Covenant and the New, and make them in a manner all one. But I build this Expoſition and Doctrine, chiefly upon the clear differencing and opening of the Covenants. 3 When they ſay we are juſtified by the works of the Goſpell, they mean only that we are ſanctified by works that follow faith, and are beſtowed by grace, they meriting our inherent juſtice at Gods hands. In a word, there is ſcarce any one Doctrine wherein even their most learned Schoolmen are moſt ſottiſhly ignorant then in this of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:167891:323"/> So that when you have read them with profit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light on ſome other ſubjects; when they come to this, you would pitty them, and admire their ignorance. 4 They take our works to be part of our legal Righteouſnes: I take them not to be the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt portion of it, but only a part of our Evangelicall righteouſneſs, or of the condition upon which Chriſts righteouſnes ſhall be ours.</q>
                        <p>Suppoſe all theſe things were true, and the difference between him and the Papiſts were ſo great and manifold, as in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars he pretendeth, yet all this nothing evinceth his Doctrine not to be Popiſh, eſpecially among Scholars to whom he appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For 1 All this would but excuſe him <hi>a tanto, non a toto,</hi> that in theſe particulars he is not, though in many other and greater, he be Popiſh.</p>
                        <p>2 Though he differed from them in the premiſſes, yet he is one with them in the coneluſion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings his arguments, and <hi>Stapleton</hi> his, to prove that works juſtifie. Are they not both Papiſts, becauſe their arguments differ, when their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is one? Mr. <hi>Br</hi> thinks, that in ſome particulars his curious wit hath prompted him with a finer and ſurer way of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtabliſh Juſtification by works, than ever entered into the Cardinals Cap or Cranion: Doth this deny him to be a Papiſt, becauſe he ſpeaks more for them than they could for themſelves? 3 Though <hi>Bellarmins</hi> and <hi>Brs.</hi> way of arguing do in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars differ, yet is the later as great an oppoſite to the truth of the Goſpell in his way, as the former in his. Both oppugn with their utmoſt ſtrength the doctrine of grace, though they divide the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell between them, the one ſcaling from the North, the other from the South.</p>
                        <p>2 But it cannot be truly ſayd, that there are truly thoſe reall differences between Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> and the Papiſts Doctrine, which hee here particularizeth. For 1 Though in ſome of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars he ſpeaks not the <hi>idem,</hi> yet he ſpeaks the <hi>Tantundem</hi> with them. 2 Where he ſpeaks not the very <hi>idem,</hi> hee ſpeaks more groſly, Phariſaically, and adverſatively to the truth then they. For the manifeſting hereof, let us particularly examine thoſe particulars in which he ſaith he differs from them.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>1 Saith he,</hi> They take juſtifying for ſanctifying, ſo do not I.</q>
                        <p n="1">1 This ſpeaks out their Doctrine to be more tolerable then his. For the Scripture denies not the increaſe of ſanctification to be in part by works (which is all that the Papiſts hold) But accurſeth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:167891:324"/> them that ſhall attribute Juſtification either in its beginning or growth (if there were any ſuch thing) to works. 2 It is not true, that the Papiſts make whole or all Juſtification to conſiſt in Sanctification. For in their many diviſions and diſtinctions of Juſtification, among the reſt they have this. There is a firſt and a ſecond juſtification. The former of Infants and new Converts conferred in baptiſm. This conſiſts in remiſſion of ſins meerly by the blood of Chriſt, ſprinkled by the Spirit in Baptiſm upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that are not of age actually to believe; and received alſo by Faith by believing Converts in their Baptiſm. The later end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they make to conſiſt in the infuſion of the habit of grace and ſanctification: when the juſtified man, <hi>ex juſto juſtior fit,</hi> is more and more juſtified. This will afterward be manifeſted: So that all Scholars muſt acknowledg Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> to have the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every apex the <hi>Idem</hi> of this Doctrine. Yea worſe is his doctrine in this particular than theirs. For he makes Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good works a Collateral with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in juſtifying. They abandon this doctrine, teaching that they are but fruits of Gods grace and Chriſts merits. Thus he ſets up vain man as Cheek-mate with Chriſt, they ſet him at his foot-ſtool, or appoint him to follow and apprehend the hemm of his garment, to draw vertue from him, though indeed to other and prouder ends then he hath ordained.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Br.</hi> They quite overthrow and deny the moſt reall difference between the Old Covenant and the New; and making them in a manner one, I build upon the clear differencing and opening of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</q>
                        <p>1 All this is ſaid, not ſhewed and proved. 2 If the Papiſts did wholly as he ſaith, Mr. Br. to every particle of what he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them with, might tune up the Poets Epigram, <hi>Jam ſumus ergo pares: Jam ſumus ergo pares.</hi> In all this we ſhake hands. What fouler confounding of the Covenants can there be then what Mr. <hi>Br</hi> hath committed: when he makes <hi>DO, and LIVE,</hi> to be the voyce of both Covenants, denying any uſefulneſs to Faith it ſelf in juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but as it is a deed and morall work. Let Babel it ſelf be raked from end to end, there will not be found more confuſion. The Papiſts ſay, doing and works, as works and doing cannot be our righteouſneſs to juſtifie us: But as they receive purification from the blood and grace of Chriſt, ſo they obtain acceptance with God, and becom our righteouſnes to juſtifie us. Chriſt (ſay they)
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:167891:324"/> hath merited that our fulfilling of the Law ſhould juſtifie us. Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſaith nay, but our fulfilling the works which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, meriteth that we ſhould receive Chriſt to Juſtification (as we ſhall ſee by and by) Let now any rationall man judg which party doth moſt confound the Covenants, he that makes the works of the Law in and for themſelves, as they are ſimply done, meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Juſtification: or they that aſcribe nothing to works but what they have from Chriſt. Both I acknowledg are to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; but the deeper grain of ſelf-extolling, the more ſenſuall luſting after the fleſh-pots of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is in Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> Doctrine. Let none object that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> attributes it not to works as works of the Law, but of the Goſpel, himſelf knoweth and hath learned that poor ſhift of the Papiſts; and that they come off handſomer with it upon their, then it is poſſible for him to do upon his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax. 3.</hi> They are ſottiſhly ignorant in the Doctrine of Juſtification [ſo am not I.]</q>
                        <p>This I conceive he puts as a third difference between his and their doctrine. For what he ſaith under this third particular, that when they ſay juſtified, they mean ſanctified, that he had made before the firſt difference. If this be the difference, then is he much more guilty than they. <hi>I obtained mercie, becauſe I did it of ignorance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, implying that they which did it maliciouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of their own underſtandings, were excluded from mercy. <hi>He that knoweth his fathers will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Yet I conceive Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> means here the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ancient times of Barbariſm: not the Jeſuits, Arminians, Socinians, and other Scholaſtick, Phyloſophick Theologaſters of theſe later times: For theſe are ſo knowing (in Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> account) in the doctrine of Juſtification, that hee hath borrowed all his knowledg and doctrine from them. And why the former ſhould be eſteemed more ſottiſhly ignorant in this than in other no leſſe myſteriall doctrines of the Goſpel I know not. In thingt naturall and morall indeed they wrote as learned Philoſophers, ſo farr as refined reaſon could conduct them. But in things purely Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall (ſaving about the perſons and natures of Chriſt, which they alſo handled more Metaphyſically than Theologically) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome fragments gathered out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I could hardly ever meet with a ſound piece in ſuch of them as have come to my reading. There may be a time when Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> may recant his profit
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:167891:325"/> and delight in dipping holy waters from the muddy ſtreams, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the pure fountain of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>Or if he puts the difference in the former words;</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax. 3</hi> When they ſay we are juſtified by the works of the Goſpel, they mean onely that wee are ſanctified by works that follow Faith, and are beſtowed by Grace, they meriting our inherent Juſtice before God.</q>
                        <p>And in that which ſtandeth as it were in a fourth place.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Bax.</hi> They take our works to be part our legall, I take it only a part of our Evangelicall righteouſnes: or of the condition upon which Chriſts righteouſneſs ſhall be ours.</q>
                        <p>Not to except here againſt his maimed alleadging of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, thereby feigning a diſtance from them, that hee might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure his readers without ſuſpition to joyn as neer with them as himſelf: Let us take it for truth what he ſaith of them, and then let the indifferent Reader judg. 1 Whether is the moſt arrogant Doctrine, the Papiſts that ſay, works that follow, and are the fruits of Faith, and are done in the ſtrength of grace ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally infuſed into the ſoul do merit? or Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> that ſaith, works as concauſes with, not fruits of Faith, that flow from no other grace, but <hi>Pelagius</hi> his morall Suaſion, without any Phyſicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and change upon the will (as for diſtinctions ſake ſome of our Divines are wont to expreſs themſelves) do ſo merit? If Mr. Br. mean any thing els by grace, he conceals it as a myſterie from us, and will not throughout his whole book give one hint at it: but makes man in his own naturall and morall qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the meriter of his own Juſtification by Chriſt. 2 Or which aſcribes moſt to works, they that attribute to them inherent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which is the leſſer; or hee that aſcribes to them the meriting of Chriſts imputed righteouſnes, which is the greater? Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legall and Evangelicall Righteouſneſs, I have ſpoken enough before: And the phraſe of the Papiſts and Mr. Br. is one and the ſame herein.</p>
                        <p>This might ſuffice to take off this deluſion from his Readers, that his Doctrine is not Popiſh. But to manifeſt more fully in the ſight of the Sun, that every one may run reading it, and read it running, how groſly, and in how many particulars his Doctrine is Papiſticall, I ſhall draw out in a parallel his Doctrine, and the Doctrine of the Papiſts, ſetting them ſide by ſide, that whoſoever will, by comparing them may determine whether there be any

                                    <p>1. THere is a two-fold Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, a firſt and a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Juſtification: the one inchoate, unperfect, more properly to be termed the beginning or root of and a diſpoſition to juſtification, or being juſtified, than Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, or our being fully juſtified before God.</p>
                                    <p>2 The firſt juſtification is by the firſt grace given, before all good works for the remiſſion of ſins for the meer merits of Chriſt to Infants by baptiſm, to them that are of Age by Faith. The ſecond juſtification, is by new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and good works, by which the faithfull deſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Righteouſneſs to their fuller Juſtification.</p>
                                    <pb n="216" facs="tcp:167891:326"/>
                                    <p>3 Good works are the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification, without which Chriſts ſatisfaction is not applyed to us. [<hi>Of this opinion</hi> Bellarmine <hi>affirmeth ſome of his fellows to be, and finds no fault with it or them, onely himſelf takes up what ſeem'd to him more probable. Himſelf alſo ſpeaks to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>] The Goſpel promiſing life upon condition of actuall &amp; working Righteouſneſs which conſiſts in keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandents.</p>
                                    <p>4 It is falſe therefore that we are juſtified by Faith onely, the Scriptures no where affirm it, let him be accurſed that ſhall ſay it. Many other graces, vertues and works are required to it, <hi>viz.</hi> The fear of God, hope in his mercy, Love, Repentance, a deſire to receive the Sacraments, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to lead a new life, and keep the Commandements [<hi>under this l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                                    <p>
                                       <hi>Nay ſo far are both parties from this Faith, that Faith onely juſtifieth, that Both teach we are juſtified by Works only.</hi> For</p>
                                    <p>5 We are juſtified by the Act of Faith, which is a work, and a Law, ſo that if we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:167891:326"/>by works, Faith it ſelf muſt be excluded from juſtifying. Though we are not juſtified by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny works (<hi>i. e.</hi>) by any works of the Law, yet by a work of the Goſpel, ſuch as Faith is, we may be juſtified.</p>
                                    <p>6 Our Adverſaries (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Proteſtants) conſent together in this, that good works are not neceſſary to ſalvation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the neceſſity of their preſence, but that they have not any relation to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as merits, or cauſes, or conditions thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe ſay that good works are neceſſary to a righteous man, unto ſalvation, by way of [cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality or] efficiency, becauſe [they effect] or work ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                                    <p>7 When the Apoſtle ſaith, we are juſtified by Faith and not by Works, there is to be underſtood a Synecdoche in the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> that when he ſaith we are juſtified by Faith, hee meaneth [not without works, but] by Faith and works together, [<hi>ſo that Faith is put for Faith, &amp; works of Faith.</hi>]</p>
                                    <p>8 The good works of juſtified men [which effect their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation]
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:167891:327"/>are abſolutely juſt and in their Mode or manner, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                                    <p>9 So the perfection of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and Juſtification is not from Faith but from works, For Faith doth but begin Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and afterward it hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it ſelf Hope and Charity, it doth [by theſe] perfect it.</p>
                                    <p>10 Good works merit without all doubt, yet not by any intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall vertue and worth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by vertue of Gods promiſe. A promiſe made with a condition of work, brings to paſs that he which performs the work, is ſaid to have merited the thing promiſed, and may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the reward as his debt in Law.</p>
                                    <p>11 The Hereticks teach that it is unpoſſible for a righteous man to fullfill Gods Law. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks teach that it is abſolutely poſſible for a righteous man to fullfill it, by the help of Gods Grace, and Spirit of Faith and Charity infuſed into them in their Juſtification.</p>
                                    <p>12 The contrary doctrine w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> denyeth Juſtification by works, and the Merit of works is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:167891:327"/>doctrine, an enemy to all good endeavours &amp; good works, invites all to a licentiouſneſs of ſinning, and to tranſgreſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear or ſhame; what evil will he fear, or what good will he not deſpiſe, who thinks faith alone ſufficient to righteouſneſs?</p>
                                    <p>13 Though a man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the infuſion of grace, and the Spirit of Faith and Charity, and is now juſtified, yet he is under the penalty and curſe of the Law ſtill. For Chriſt hath given and God hath taken ſatiſfaction one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the fault, but not for the puniſhment, ſo that when God hath fully pardoned the fault, he may and will inflict the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the offender.</p>
                                    <p>14 Yea this puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains upon the Juſtified both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life and death, and after death in Purgatory.</p>
                                    <p>15 For the Righteous or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man is ſo under the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Law, that except he ſhall fullfill it, he ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                                    <p>16 Becauſe our Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill conditionall, even after we are Juſtified, may be ſomtimes loſt, ſomtimes reteined, now had, and then loſt, and after recovered yea and loſt again, as we do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or not hinder the Grace of God.</p>
                                    <p>17 No man can be aſſured of his eternall Election, that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:167891:328"/>of God to life; or of his perſeverance in grace to the end; and conſequently not of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For the Scripture in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words teacheth, that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends of the condition of works; But no man can certainly conclude that he ſhall do [much leſs perſevere to do] all that Chriſt hath Commanded.</p>
                                    <p>18 It cannot be that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt be imputed to us in that ſenſe that by it we may be called, and be formally righteous; although it be true that Chriſts merits be imputed to us, becauſe God hath made them ours by donation, and we may offer them to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſinns, becauſe Chriſt hath taken upon him the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of making ſatisfaction for us, and of reconciling us to God the Father: yet the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteous perſons is from the intrinſecall righteouſnes in themſelves.</p>
                                    <p>19 Though we are juſtified by the works which the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, yet are we not juſtified by them as they are works of the Law; but as they are Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:167891:328"/>and works of the Goſpel, done in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and by the power of renewing grace powred upon the Elect by Chriſt under the Goſpel.</p>
                                    <p>20 Love or Charity is the form of Juſtifying Faith, ſo that when faith doth Juſtifie, it juſtifieth by charity as its form which gives it its life and motion; ſo that if Faith juſtifieth, love juſtifieth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an equality with it, or more than it.</p>
                                    <p>21 Juſtifying Faith conſiſteth in the Aſſent of the judgement to all things which are written in the word of God: No other faith is required of any. But an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Faith is ſufficient in the Laity and ignorant, which are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures, in whom it is enough to beleeve as the Church beleeveth, <hi>i. e.</hi> as their Clergy teacheth and beleeveth, though they do not explicitly and in particulars know what the Church beleeveth.</p>

                                    <p>1 IT is to be noted that the Scripture attributeth this imputation of Righteouſneſs to no other thing but Faith.</p>
                                    <p>2 Faith hath not of it ſelf any efficacy, as it is our act, to forgive and reconcile: but all its vertue proceeds from its object, namely Chriſt, whoſe vertue and merit God hath diſpoſed to apply to the ſinner unto Juſtification, by Faith on him.</p>
                                    <p>3 If it be enquired how the Law of Faith is diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the Law of works, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of morall works, when Faith alſo is comprehended under the genus [or kind] of works; for to beleeve is our work: The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is, that to beleeve in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Righteouſnes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to wit, of God through Chriſt: but other works do lean upon their own Righteouſneſs; every work is in [or after] it ſelf
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:167891:330"/>good, and makes him good that hath it.</p>
                                    <p>4 If Faith as it is a certain Act, and of it ſelf, ſhould procure Righteouſneſs, then were not Righteouſneſs given freely. God hath not uſed works to juſtifie, as he hath uſed Faith, that men ſhould not boaſt, attributing Righteouſneſs to the vertue or merit of works.</p>
                                    <p>5 Faith is not counted to us for Righteouſneſs, as if it ſelf were made our Righteouſneſs; but becauſe it brings a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs on man before God; not as it is an act of man, then Grace ſhould be of works, for to beleeve is a kind of work: but of Gods will, as he hath willed that Righteouſneſs ſhould be given to man by Faith, and the vertue of Chriſt upon whom man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, ſhould be communicated to the beleever. This is to count [or impute] Faith to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs before God.</p>
                                    <p>6 Whereas we attain a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Righteouſneſs by Faith, an inherent Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which we become pertakers of Gods nature; and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:167891:330"/>
                                       <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It remains to be enquired, upon which of theſe we ought to lean [or truſt] and to account our ſelves juſtified before God? My judgment is that we are to reſt, to reſt I ſay as upon a ſtable thing that firmly ſuſteineth, namely the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, and not on the holineſs and grace inherent in our ſelves. For this is unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore we cannot for it be counted Righteous before God. But the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, in which there is nothing that can offend the eyes of God, but all things that can abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly pleaſe him. <hi>
                                          <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this alone</hi> therefore are we to reſt as upon a thing ſure and ſtable, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that by it alone we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
                                    <p>7 This may undoubtedly be affirmed, and it is the opinion of all Divines, that God can juſtifie men and make them pleaſing and amiable to him, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent quality or habits infuſed.</p>
                                    <p>8 <hi>To the ſame purpoſe and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fully ſpeaketh Bellarmine.</hi> The guilt or obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away without the infuſion of Righteouſnes. For nothing hinders by how much the leſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:167891:331"/>God can will the not ordeining to puniſhment, and the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the offence, and the not accounting him for an enemy, to whom he hath not granted the gift of habituall Righteouſneſs.</p>
                                    <p>9 The Scope of <hi>James</hi> (in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle) is to ſhew that we are juſtified not by a barren but by a fruitfull Faith.</p>
                                    <p>10 The meaning of <hi>James</hi> is not that Faith without works is dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is evident that we are juſtified by Faith even without works. But his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Faith without works, that is which refuſeth to work, or is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                          <desc>•</desc>
                                       </gap> diſpoſed to work, is a dead Faith, vain and juſtifieth not. What therefore <hi>James</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of <hi>Gen. 15. Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved God,</hi> to this purpoſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth it, that he beleeved being in readineſs to work. Therefore he ſaith that in the work of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son, the Scripture was fulfilled, ſpeaking of his Faith prepared to work: It was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (I ſay) as to the execution of that great work, to which his Faith was prepared.</p>
                                    <p>11 If any where in Scripture thou heareſt reward or wages promiſed, know that it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe due then by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:167891:331"/>freely he hath promiſed, freely he gives. If thou wilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in his Grace and Favour, make no mention of thy Merits.</p>
                                    <p>12 All Papiſts conſentingly make the Merits of Chriſt the foundation of mans merits, as far as he can merit. Neither Faith nor works, nor doing nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings (ſay they) have any other vertue to merit then what they receive from the merits of Chriſts death, then as they are dipt in his blood; this makes them accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Father.</p>
                                    <p>13 When Chriſt ſaith of the woman, <hi>Luk. 7. 47. Many ſins are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much;</hi> it is to be underſtood not that ſhe loved much, and ſo her much love was the cauſe of her great forgiveneſs, but contrarywiſe that becauſe many ſins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her, therefore ſhe loved much.</p>
                                    <p>14 To be given freely, and to be a retribution to works, are as much oppoſit, as that which is free and that which is from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or as not due, and debt. And this way of inference the Apoſtle uſeth in the beginning of this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                                       <pb n="228" facs="tcp:167891:332"/>Chapter [<hi>viz.</hi> ſpeaking of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Grace.]</p>
                                    <p>15 The work of Juſtice is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Reward, and this way of Juſtice Grace excludeth, whoſe work is meer gift or Donation.</p>
                                    <p>16 In this verſe the Apoſtle concludeth that Chriſt hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us from all the evill both of fault and puniſhment. That there is nothing of condemnation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to them that are in Chriſt, becauſe all judgment is taken away both to the fault and the puniſhment.</p>
                                    <p>17 It is certain that when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſin is remited, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which it brought are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and taken away, as all finde by experience: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they remain not under the conſideration of puniſhment, becauſe the fault being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there can be no deſert, as to puniſhment, remaining.</p>
                                    <p>18 <hi>I will remember their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties no more,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will neither in this world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join any Penance for them, nor in that which is to come inflict any puniſhment for them. So hath the Holy Ghoſt promiſed that our ſins ſhall be forgiven by the New Covenant of Grace.</p>
                                    <p>19 In regard of the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our own righteouſneſs, and the danger of vain glory: it is

                        </argument>
                        <p>THe ſecond aſperſion of infamy, from which he endeavours to vindicate his doctrine is <hi>Socinianiſm:</hi> This hee goeth about to do in theſe words:</p>

                           <hi>Bax.</hi> p. 306. But what difference is there betwixt it and the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian doctrine of Juſtification? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſome mens mouths, Socinianiſm is but a word of reproach, or a ſtone to throw at the head of any man that ſaith not as they. Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> is a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, and Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and why not <hi>Piſcator, Pareus,</hi> &amp;c. if ſome zealous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines know what Socinianiſm is. But I had rather ſtudy what is Scripture-truth than what is Socinianiſm. I do not thinke that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was ſo infauſtus as to hold nothing true. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he held according to Scripture is not Socinianiſm. For my part I have read little of their writings, but that little gave me enough, and made me caſt them away with abhorrence. In a word, The Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians acknowledg not that Chriſt had ſatisfied the Law for us, &amp; conſequently is none of our legall righteouſneſs, but only hath ſet us a Copie to write after, and is become our pattern, and that we are juſtified by following him as a Captain and guide to heaven; and ſo all our proper Righteouſneſs is in this Obedience. Moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Doctrine! ſo far am I from this, that I ſay, The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:167891:333"/> which we muſt plead againſt the Laws Accuſation, is not one grain of it in our Faith or Works, but all out of us in Christs ſatisfaction. Only our Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience are the conditions upon which wee muſt partake of the former: And yet ſuch conditions as Chriſt worketh in us frely by his Spirit.</q>
                        <p>How forcible and unreſiſtible is the power of Conſcience, flying in the face of the guilty, and accuſing where men applaud, or at leaſt hold their peace? Who either of men or Angels could have charged Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> for ſaying that which he had not yet ſaid? or for venting Socinian Doctrine in his writings before he had yet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? What none els can do, M. <hi>Br.</hi> is forced by Conſcience to do againſt himſelf: to arraign himſelf at the Bar for <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the accuſer, what Patron will he retein to be his defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Nothing out of himſelf can ſuffice to anſwer an accuſer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf: Therefore he fees Reaſon, that is his ſophiſticated, and ſopiſticall wit, art, and craft, to plead his Cauſe againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe exceptions which theſe make for him againſt the Charge, is the abuſe which ſome make of this imputation, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon all that ſpeak not as they.</p>
                        <p>But 1. This is beſides the Charge: Theſe ſome had not then ſpoken againſt Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> it is the accuſation of his own conſcience which he ſhould have anſwered, and he hnows it not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with thoſe ſome of whom he ſpeaketh.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I know none of thoſe ſome that have layd that aſperſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of thoſe Divines which he mentioneth ſave one; and that one I ſuppoſe would be very angry with any other man in <hi>England</hi> (M. <hi>Br.</hi> alone excepted) that ſhould go about to rob him of that honour which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> calls a reproach. It is for brotherhoods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that he hears it from him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But his craft herein is to befool his Readers with an opinion that he is of the ſame judgment with <hi>Pareus, Wotton, Gataker,</hi> &amp;c. of whom they that are dead have as much ſhewed their abhorrency from, and oppoſition againſt his Doctrines, as any that have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon earth. And thoſe that are living, if they be conſiſtent with themſelves in their former writings (whereof I nothing doubt) are as far from Mr <hi>Br.</hi> as he is from Chriſt and his truth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His jeer that he caſteth upon them that are Adverſaries to his Doctrine, terming them Zealous Divines, infinuating that they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:167891:333"/> have zeale without knowledg and learning, I leave as proper to him that in that way of wiſdom and righteouſneſs which his own reaſon either as refined with Philoſophy, or corrupted with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry ſuggeſteth, ſeeks for juſtification and eternall glory. Let us be accounted fools to the world, and no bodies in that which is falſly called ſcience, ſo that we may be wiſe in, and zealous for that which is the power and wiſedom of God to ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Plea which he makes for himſelf is the ſinglenes and ſincerity of his ſtudies, bent rather to ſeek out <hi>what is Scripture truth than what is Socinianiſm,</hi> &amp; that he thinks that <hi>Socinus</hi> his Nature, Studies, and Attainments did not ſo much vary from his name. <hi>Fauſtus, the happy, that he ſhould be ſo unhappy as to hold nothing true:</hi> and conſequently that neither himſelf is ſo unhappy, but that he hath learned ſome Truths from this happy <hi>Socinus,</hi> and perhaps ſuch as he could never learn from Chriſt, his Apoſtles, or faithfull Miniſters.</p>
                        <p>But 1. This may be ſaid of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the Conjurer, who by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf to the Devill, did not exterminate all notions of all truths from his ſoul. Will Mr <hi>Br.</hi> be his Diſciple alſo? Both had the like effectuall influence from Satan, neither know I which to prefer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Who ſent Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> to learn from ſuch Teachers? to ſeek for light in darkneſs, or Heaven in Hell, or Scripture-Truth, in the precept of Pagans, or gloſſes of Papiſts, or <hi>Socinus</hi> his God Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? <hi>Is it not becauſe there is no God in Iſrael, that he goes to enquire of Baal-zebab the God of Ekron?</hi> 2 King. 1. 3. <hi>The Lord Jeſus rebuketh, ſilenceth, and refuſeth to hear the Spirit of lies, even when hee ſpeaks truth,</hi> Mar. 1. 23, 24, 25. <hi>and abandoneth the ſpirituall Devil no leſs than if he had blaſphemed,</hi> Mat. 4. So alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16. 16-18. The truth of Chriſt needs not any, diſdains all props from Hell to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain it.

                        <p n="3">3. It is much to be doubted the mans heart deceives him. Were his ſtudie ſo unfeigned and ſerious to know what is <hi>Scripture truth,</hi> he would more ſtudy the Scripture it ſelf, and leſs <hi>Bellarmin, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Arminius,</hi> and ſuch like Sophiſters, whoſe whole ſtudy it is to corrupt all, and to leave no Scripture unperverted.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Had he not ploughed with <hi>Socinus</hi> his Heyfers (or rather Bulls) he could never have ſowed ſo much darnell in the field of Chriſt.</p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:167891:334"/>
                        <p>The third Plea which he bringeth to prove that his Doctrine is free from Socinianiſm is, becauſe there is one point wherein hee diſſenteth from <hi>Secinus.</hi> That <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers deny any expiatory ſacrifice that Chriſt hath offred to God to ſatisfie his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for our ſins; or that ther is any effectual vertue in <hi>Chriſts</hi> death to purge our Conſciences from dead works. But that he becomes our Saviour only in this, that [he hath given us more perfect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Righteouſneſs than were contained in the Law and the Prophets, and withall he] hath given us a Copie or pattern by his own practice to which we muſt be conformed: And ſo we muſt be juſtified (not by the blood of Chriſt, but) by our own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in following theſe precepts and this pattern which he hath given us. In this point Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> profeſſeth himſelf ſo farr from joyning with him, that hee caſteth off this Doctrine with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                        <p>But this reaſoning hath no ſoundneſs in it: For</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is the ſame, as if I ſhould argue, that <hi>Goliah</hi> was not of the race of the Giants, becauſe he had not upon each hand ſix fingers, and upon each foot ſix toes, at ſome of the Giants progeny had, and poſſibly the Giant himſelf. Or that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſhould ſeek by this Argument to prove himſelf no Engliſh-man, becauſe he dwels neerer the Severn than Thames. So alſo might the Jews elude the words of Chriſt, and <hi>Elymas</hi> the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſlanderous, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing themſelves not to be the children of the Devill, becauſe they had fleſh and bone, ſo had not the Devill. They had never carried Chriſt aloft, and ſet him on a pinacle of the Temple (fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might fall headlong thence themſelves) ſo had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. The ſeed, the Luſts of the Devil abiding and reigning in them, ſpake them out to be children of the Devill, though they brake not out in them into every particular Act as in the Devill. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that M. <hi>Br.</hi> can from ſuch premiſſes conclude is, that (though in many things els it be, yet) in this one his Doctrine is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed with <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. I think it will not be objected by any to M. <hi>Br.</hi> that he is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious in all things to be a Socinian, but in ſuch only wherein the <hi>Socinians</hi> are moſt ſubtle Sophiſters than the Jeſuites, and doe bring more ſhew of ſophiſticated reaſon to exalt Popery than the Papiſts themſelves, and with greater plauſibility and craft do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the truth and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, more extolling mans pride, and more nullifying Gods grace, than any of the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:167891:334"/> of the Pope had either the wit or the audacity to do untill theſe had taught them. If then in the before-mentioned point hee holds not with <hi>Socinus,</hi> no marvell, for then ſhould he have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Papiſts. I do not think that his wits do run in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Racovia,</hi> upon any other grounds but in love to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in abhorrence of free Jeruſalem, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hee ſhould have cleered (if hee could) his Doctrine from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peeces of Socinianiſm, which he knows it guilty of, &amp; would be objected againſt him. As 1. His <hi>To Credere,</hi> or Act of believing, juſtifying a ſinner 2. All other works of obedience, as our Acts or works, juſtifying in an equality, and in the ſame manner with Faith (without mentioning any vertue that they have from the death of Chriſt to this end, as the Papiſts teach, but rather that Chriſt fetcheth vertue from theſe to juſtifie:) 3 His doctrine of Gods diſpenſing with, and relaxing of his Law. To which I might add in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> place, his canonizing and almoſt deifying Reaſon, and that without any adject of (renewed or ſpiritualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, even of) naturall and ſophiſticall reaſon, to which he doth ſo frequently in his book almoſt ſacrifice as to the ſole and ſufficient Judg of the Scriptures, and guide unto ſalvation. Theſe things he cannot deny to be originally from <hi>Socinus,</hi> though probably brought home to him by other dirty Channels, and not dipt from the ſpring or rather puddle it ſelf. It is but a vain piece of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry to defend himſelf where none will accuſe, and to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the dark, where ke knows he ſhould meet with oppoſition and accuſation.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 He profeſſeth himſelf to be but yet a puny in the School of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> hath read but little of their doctrine, yet is much ſowred with the Leaven thereof, when hee hath more fully tryed the quaintnes &amp; depth of their ſophiſtry (in which his ſoul delighteth more than in the plainnes &amp; fooliſhnes of the Goſpel) who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether he may not, following ſuch a guide as reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at length alſo ſup up with pleaſure what now he caſteth off with defiance? the Apoſt. ſpeaks ſomthing that may put us in fear of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Even this error of <hi>Socinus,</hi> againſt which in ſpeciall he prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his abhorrence, he doth in generall maintain with as ſtrong a Front as any of the Socinians. They ſay that Chriſt offereth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all, but it is every particular mans particular faith and obedience, their actuall believing and obeying, following his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and treading in his ſteps to the end, that in the end makes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:167891:335"/> him to be actually and effectually a Saviour to them. And this is the ſum and full dimenſion of Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> doctrine. Only they make Chriſt the Prophet chiefly, but this man Chriſt as Prieſt and King, to be the Saviour. In this they both agree, that except we by our own righteouſneſſ become ſelf-Saviours, we ſhall have no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him.</p>
                        <p>What elſe he hath in this Section for the vindicating, yea mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of his doctrine, hath been oft ſpoken to already, and will a little after be examined again, where hee uſeth the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> though not literally the <hi>Idem</hi> of theſe words, to apologize for his doctrine againſt other crimes imputable to it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> firſt Reaſon examined, by which he endeavours to evince his Doctrine not to be repugnant to <hi>Pauls,</hi> viz. that <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion in his Epiſtles, and his queſtion in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, are not one but divers. <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, what is that proper Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified from the laws malediction, which the Apoſtle concludeth to be Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction only. But Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi> his question, what is the condition of this Juſtification by Chriſts Righteouſnes, whether Faith alone, or works alſo?</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WEe have examined what he hath to ſay for the vindicating of his Doctrine from Popery and Socinianiſm: we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted alſo that hee ſhould in the next place have ſhewed, or at leaſt pretended ſome diſtance between him and the <hi>Arminians:</hi> But it ſeems he glories in it as his Crown to be reputed one of their part. Therefore leaving this, he undertakes a greater Task, an Hercule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Labour in his third diſpute of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> to cleer his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from all oppoſition to <hi>Paul</hi> and the Scriptures. This is a work indeed, which if hee diſcharge honourably, and full up to what he promiſeth, all will grant him the Lawrell above all the Angelical and Seraphical Divines that have in any age made uſe of ink and paper. It is the ſole thing that we long after for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Let him bleſs us with ſound demonſtrations to prove it, wee ſhall all run after him: And though ſome madd men may
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:167891:335"/> term us Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, or whatſoever elſe, we ſhal gladly bear it to become his Diſciples. All what elſe he hath ſaid would be ſuperfluous to every conſcientious man. This alone would win him: But how poorly and Pigmie-like this ſuppoſed Giant diſchargeth this bold adventure, let his owne words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>B. p. 307, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, let us ſee whether S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Scripture do contract (I thinke it ſhould be printed [do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict]) this. And for my part I know no one word in the Bible that hath any ſtrong appearance of contradiction to it. The uſuall places quoted are theſe, <hi>Rom. 3. 28. &amp; 4. 2, 3, 14, 15, 16. Gal. 2. 16. &amp; 3. 21, 22. Eph. 2. 8, 9. Phil. 3. 8, 9.</hi> In all which, and in all other the like places you ſhall eaſily perceive, 1 That the Apoſtles diſpute is upon this queſtion, what is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which we muſt plead againſt the accuſation of the Law? or by which we are juſtified as by the proper Righteouſneſs of that Law? And this he well concludeth, is neither works nor Faith, but the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, that is Chriſts Righteouſnes.</p>
                           <p>But now St. <hi>James</hi> his queſtion is, what is the condition of our Juſtification by this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? whether Faith onely? or works alſo?</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This is the firſt part of this his Diſpute: Let us examine what force it hath to the end for which he uſeth it, whether it reconciles <hi>Paul</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Br.</hi> or ſhew they never contradicted one the other?</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>He tells us he knows no one word in St.</hi> Paul <hi>or the Bible, that hath any ſtrong appearance of contradiction to his Doctrine.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That wee look not to appearances whether they be weak or ſtrong: But if there be not ſtrong Contradictions in the doctrine of the Apoſtle, and of the Goſpel to his, there is no cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Who more blind and ignorant than hee that will not know and ſee?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 No marvail if hee ſee not while hee looks thorow the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Naturall reaſon and ſophiſticall reaſonings, whereas <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things cannot be diſcerned but ſpiritually,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Let him examine whether the words of Chriſt be not verified upon him. <hi>For judgment I am come into the world, that they which ſee not might ſee, and they which ſee might be made blind,</hi> Joh. 9. 39. <hi>But
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:167891:336"/> bleſſed be God who hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them to babes,</hi> Mat. 11. 25.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 If he ſee not, know not, his wilful ignorance and blindneſſe muſt not be made the rule of other mens Faith and Judgment, nor prejudice their happineſs in ſeeing and knowing. It is ſomewhat a lofty language, he hnoweth not. What then? Therefore either there is no ſuch thing, or no man can know it, or it is a fancy in any other to believe it. Not Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> but Chriſt is our <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> wee draw the Treaſures of wiſedom and knowledg from Chriſt, not from Mr. <hi>Br.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hee acknowledgeth that other men at leaſt ſeem to know what he denies himſelf to know, Scriptures that have (if not a ſtrong, yet) ſome appearance of Contradiction to him, and quotes the Scriptures, which he ſaith are uſually quoted, <hi>viz.</hi> Rom. 3. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here 1 I demand of him who they are that quote, and againſt whom they quote thoſe Scriptures? That they which quote them are the Proteſtant Churches and writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt whom they are ſo uſually quoted, he muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, becauſe he can produce none but Proteſtants that do, none but Papiſts againſt whom they do alledg theſe Scripures. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Arminians</hi> do enough declare themſelves in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that they hold in common with the Papiſts, Juſtification by works, yet I could never find that they would ſuffer this Tenet to be brought to a diſpute; but being charged therewith, they have with ſacred proteſtations &amp; adjurations denyed any ſuch thought in their hearts, and ſo never permitted theſe or any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be quoted againſt them about this queſtion, ſtill declining the diſpute. It muſt be therefore the Papiſts againſt whom Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſaith theſe Scriptures have been uſually quoted. And this ſpeaks out to us in many reſpects what the frame of this mans ſpirit is.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The integrity and ingenuity of his Conſcience, that having but 2 pages backward, verbally renounced the Papiſts and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his doctrine with theirs, he uſeth only a ſhort digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſmooth the face, end ſpit in the mouth of <hi>Socinus;</hi> and then forthwith makes a bridg of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul,</hi> to return and make peace, and confirm a league with the Papiſts, as it were ſtroking the ſhavelings and telling them. <hi>Notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid, I doubt not but ye well perceive therein the equivocations and mentall reſervations which I have learned from you. Still my horſes are your horſes, my charrets your
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:167891:336"/> charrets, I am as yee are, and your Adverſaries my Adverſaries. Mark ye well how finely I ſhall here divert from you the Scripture darts which the Hereticks fling at you.</hi> This all may ſee to be the ſum of his words, or at leaſt implyed therein.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 His conſiſtency with himſelf, that what ere-while he denyed, here he affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is not only Popiſh in this point, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a patron of the Popiſh Cauſe: And thus alſo while he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to purge his doctrine from all contradiction of Scripture, he becomes a Contradictor of himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 His honeſty in explaining his meaning at laſt, whom he poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at throughout his Treatiſe under the name of ignorant <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, viz.</hi> all that have quoted thoſe Scriptures againſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by works.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 His good will to the Proteſtant Religion, and to the doctrine of grace, that rather than theſe ſhall ſtand, he will ſay and unſay, joyn with, and borrow from Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, (and why not the Turkiſh Alcaron alſo, or whatſoever prodigies of Doctors) that ſend men to bleſſedneſſe by the merit of their owne works.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. His matchles worth ariſing out of all theſe, for which ſuch a confluence of Divines from all parts of <hi>England</hi> is made to him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch as were ere-while Zelots againſt Popery, Socinianiſm and Arminianiſm, untill they had fatted themſelves with the ſpoyls of the friends thereof. Hath not the Lord cauſe to viſit upon theſe men the breach of his Covenant, whereof they profeſſe themſelves at this day tranſcendently zealous? Is not this one principall branch thereof? Let others dream waking of the further exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſent Miniſtry of this Land, I ſee no ground of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Change but to the abaſing thereof, though my ſelf muſt take a ſhare in ſuch an abaſement. With ſuch plauſibility every where is this man and every ſeducer received in their ſowing the worſt errors, if they will but pretend a zeal againſt ſuppoſed <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians:</hi> And ſo generally is the doctrine of grace ſlighted. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to defend againſt all Opponents, that Mr. <hi>Br</hi> hath no one aſſertion in his whole Book about Juſtification by works, nor more than one, if one proof or argument to confirm ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay ſcarce any word, phraſe, or Apex, which hee hath not received from the Papiſts, Socinians, or at the beſt from the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. I acknowledg in ſome places he runs more in the <hi>Arminian,</hi> than <hi>Popiſh</hi> method and dialect, when they ſpeak more to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:167891:337"/> of mans righteouſneſſ, and annihilating of Gods grace: But in no one particle is he better then they. I appeal not only to the Learned, but alſo to the rationall among the Readers of his Book, when they looked upon its Title, <hi>Aphoriſms of Juſtification,</hi> whether they expected not that the truth of the Goſpel and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Proteſtant Churches ſhould have been ſtoutly defended by ſo Scholaſtick a man, againſt <hi>Papiſts, Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. But when contrariwiſe they find him undertaking no Combat againſt them, but all for them, and making none other his Averſaries but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, ſometimes under, ſometimes without the nick-name of <hi>Antinomians:</hi> Is it not a ſtrange piece of incredulity, when hee ſo plainly diſcovereth himſelf, not to believe him, to whom he is a Friend, and to whom an Adverſary? And a groſs deluſion to lick up as honey from the dirt of Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> ſhoos, what they deteſt as poyſon from the lips of <hi>Bellarmin, Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Arminius?</hi> But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr blame by digreſſing, therefore return to the matter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 I except againſt his quotations as done partially and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to beget in his weak and credulous Reader, an opinion that he and the Papiſts his Maſters have the whole body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on their ſide to prove Juſtification by works; But that the Proteſtants can only catch here and there a ſentence of Scripture that hath a ſeeming, and ſcarce a ſeeming to ſpeak for them. It is a Maxime of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> himſelf, that men are ſeldom bold with Scripture to force it, but they are firſt bold with Conſcience to force it, <hi>pag.</hi> 297. Yet here he is bold not only to force, but to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle Scriptures. When himſelf quoteth a Scripture to maintain his Popiſh Juſtification, ſee how he improves it in the ſame page: <hi>If it were but ſome one phraſe diſſonant from the ordinary language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhould not doubt but it were to be reduced to the reſt.

His falſe dealing herein declares his hatred of the Truth, that he will not have the Scriptures ſhine upon it in their full ſplendor, that it may not be known and embraced. Nay we have the main body of the New Teſtament ſpeaking for us, ſpecially al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Doctrinal part of the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Epheſians, Coloſſions, Hebrews,</hi> all the four Evangeliſts, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. Even theſe few Scriptures which he quoteth, affirm that man is juſtified by Faith without the deeds of the Law, that if he were juſtified by Works, he had whereof to glory and boaſt himſelf; that if they which are of the Law be heirs, Faith is made void, and the promiſe of no effect. That it is of Faith that it may be of Grace; that it is by Grace through Faith, not of Works. Were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, is there not a ſtrong appearance of Contradiction in theſe Scriptures to Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> doctrine, that we are juſtified by Faith and Works together?</p>
                        <p n="4">4 But ſee we how he evades theſe Scriptures and all other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Apoſtles, viz. <hi>That his diſpute is, what is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we muſt plead againſt the Accuſation of the Law? or by which we are juſtified as the proper Righteouſneſs of the Law? and this hee well concludeth is neither works nor faith, but the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs. But St.</hi> James <hi>his queſtion is, what is the condition of our Juſtification by this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? whether Faith only? or Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo? ſo farr Mr.</hi> Baxter.</p>
                        <p>Muſt not Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> needs be happy that hath learned ſo perfectly that which he cals elſe-where the Papiſts Feat of making the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a noſe of wax, and turning them into his own complexion. Let any one now alledg againſt him that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 1. 8.

True may hee ſay, but I am not <hi>Paul,</hi> nor an Angell from heaven, therefore the Curſe cannot fall on me.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:167891:338"/> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> is accurſed. As good grounds hath he for this as his former arguing.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſee whether his interpretation of theſe Scriptures be ſo ſolid as pretty. To that of <hi>James</hi> I have ſpoken before, therefore ſhall ſay little here. Onely I cannot omit how unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable his audacious confidence is, that he thinks it enough to ſay, without ſhewing, or endeavouring to ſhew it from the Context or otherwiſe, this is the meaning of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and that the ſcope of <hi>James</hi> his diſpute.

I ſay it, what man or Angell dares to deny it? Doth hee think all the world to be his Dioceſs, that he may force (what he hath, or ſaith he hath upon his <hi>Kederminſterians</hi>) upon the conſciences of all men an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, that all muſt believe when and becauſe he ſaith it?

Or doth he execute the office of the Popes Legate, ſpeaking to us only that which is decreed in his unerring Chair? or hath hee gotten a monopoly of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Right Reaſon, which is infallible? what elſe can hee alledg that his word muſt be taken for a Law without diſpute?

So indeed it ſeemeth, for neither God, nor reaſon, nor any thing els, but a high conceit of himſelf will be acceſſary to his reaſonleſs Concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>James</hi> his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what is the condition of our Juſtification by Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; when <hi>James</hi> in his whole diſpute there, neither expreſly nor implyedly utters a word of Chriſts righteouſneſs, or if Mr. <hi>Brs Jeſuito-Arminian</hi> condition, nor any thing that can eaſily be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Chriſt himſelf. Or where doth <hi>Paul</hi> diſpute only of the righteouſnes proper to juſtification, and not alſo of the way and means by which this righteouſneſs may be applyed to us and made ours? Or in which of his quoted Scriptures, or any other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles writings; when he excludes works, doth he exclude Faith alſo from its ſubſerviency to juſtifying?

This was the more principall queſtion upon which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before mentioned; Somewhat he ſaith to the former, but leſſe principally, and ſeldom but in ſubſerviency to this. So the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion upon which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes in his Epiſtles, and Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms, is one and the ſame, but their Concluſions abſolutely contradictory either to other. The one concludeth that Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without mans works and righteouſneſs; The other, that not faith alone, but Faith as a work together with all other works of righteouſneſſe do juſtifie, and all morall duties collaterally with Faith are required to make the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ours to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. No greater or more palpable Contradiction can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall preach another Goſpell</hi> [of Juſtification other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by Faith in Chriſt without works] <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> Whoſoever ſhall be practically a ſolifidian, truſt to a

This therefore is the next thing to be added.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then if we do but conſider to whom, and againſt whom the Apoſtle handleth theſe diſputes, (for Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> reduceth them all to his Epiſtles) it will be more than probable to every rationall man, that his moſt principall queſtion is, By what means we poſſeſſe and continue in the poſſeſſion of the righteouſneſſe which is by Chriſt, to Juſtification? And but ſecondarily, leſs principally, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to this queſtion, What the righteouſneſſe is by which we are to be juſtified. The perſons to whom he writeth were all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the pureſt and moſt eminent Churches of Chriſt, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the pure doctrine of Chriſt by the preaching of the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> that (whereas ſinn and death and the Curſe by ſinn reigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all men in all the world, ſo that all wete Children of wrath, and every ſoul guilty before God) Chriſt was given of the Father to be the Author of Righteouſneſs and life, by the Mediation of his death; that in him and in no other name under heaven was ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attainable, that whoſoever would beleeve in him ſhould have everlaſting life; ſhould be Juſtified freely by Grace through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is in Jeſus Chriſt; and by their very receiving of him ſhould obtein power to become the ſonns of God; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their former pollutions, &amp; without all prejacent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in them to purchaſe ſo great a Redemption.

But ſeeing both the ſeduced and ſeducers with whom he dealeth were ſuch as profeſſed faith in Chriſt, as their juſtifier and Saviour, and queſtioned onely whether Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or els their righteouſneſs &amp; works alſo together with Faith, were required to inright them to Chriſts righteouſnes and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it had been impertinent if not ridiculous to have made it his queſtion what the proper righteouſnes is by which we are juſtified; For this had been to decline and not to proſecute the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them. They would have granted him all that he concluded without the leaſt dammage to their Cauſe. Therefore his queſtion was principally, By what means we come to partake of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to Juſtification?</p>
                        <p>2 Let the Apoſtle himſelf give his Teſtimony what his principall queſtion was, For he better knew his own minde than Mr. <hi>Br</hi> or my ſelf. And firſt in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> having for an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the queſtion, in the three firſt Chapters proved both the <hi>Jewes</hi> with all their legall and the Gentiles with all their naturall righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs to be under ſin, guilt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, he no ſooner in the third Chapter begins to ſpeak of the mean of their recovery Chriſt Jeſus, but he annexeth alſo by what means we come to have right in him. In both which he no leſs Contradicteth Mr. <hi>Br</hi> than if he had ſeen before what Mr. <hi>Br</hi>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:167891:340"/> hath written ſo many ages after. Or the former he affirmeth <hi>that we are juſtified (as by Chriſt, ſo) by the Redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, as he was ſet forth to be a propitiation</hi> [or expiatory ſacrifice] <hi>for our ſinns,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25. Not as Mr. <hi>Br</hi> before ſo ſtoutly Contended, as he is our Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his ſenſe our Lawgiver. Of the latter, that it is <hi>faith alone that makes this redemption and Propitiation ours to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> namely, <hi>Faith in his bloud, Faith without the deeds of the Law, Faith which excludeth, without works which include boaſting,</hi> ver. 25, 27, 28. And this faith in the death of Chriſt, without works, without deeds, cannot include in it, Morall works and righteouſneſs unto Juſtification, as Mr. <hi>Br</hi> would extort from it elſewhere, by making Chriſt as our Lord and Lawgiver the object of Juſtifying Faith. At length he Concludeth <hi>ver.</hi> 30. that both in them which have ſome ſeeming and plauſible qualification of righteouſneſs and works, and in them that have it not, it is not that righteouſneſs of their own, but Faith which Juſtifieth. And that this Faith is no leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to the juſtifying of them that unto that very day, have been ungodly, than of them which from their very birth have ſeemed to be holy to the Lord. So much is Comprehended in thoſe words of the Apoſtle; <hi>It is one God which Juſtifieth the Circumciſion by faith, and the un-circumciſion through Faith.</hi> In theſe words is included the whole State of <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion. The Apoſtle writing to the Church that was at <hi>Rome,</hi> Conſiſting of beleeving Jewes and Gentiles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to heal the diviſions, Cloſe the breaches, and ſettle a ſweet union and Communion between them. This he applyeth himſelf unto, firſt in that great and fundamentall point of Chriſtianitie, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification by Chriſt, in which they diſſented: Both Jewes and Gentiles acknowledged Juſtification and ſalvation to be by Chriſt alone, but in this they differed. The Jewes Confined this ſalvation by Chriſt to themſelves alone, that to them onely he was promiſed, that they alone were qualified and in a capacity to receive him and the benefits that are by him. That he came to be the Saviour of his own hallowed people that had waited for him, not of the common and unclean Pagans that were <hi>aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe.</hi> To this purpoſe they boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of their Naturall, Faederal, and perſonall righteouſneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, qualifying them for the Juſtification which is by Chriſt, of all which the Gentiles were deſtitute. Their naturall Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, <hi>that they were Jewes by nature and not ſinners of the Gentiles, the ſeed of Abraham the holy ſtock to whom and whoſe ſeed the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:167891:341"/> promiſe was made:</hi> Their Faederall holines, <hi>That they alone of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in Covenant with God, and did bear the badge and ſeal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Circumciſion in their Fleſh, by which they were diſtinguiſhd from all other people,</hi> as holy to God, when all other Nations under the Sunne were an abhomination in his ſight: Their Legall holineſs that they had the Law, Word, and Oracles of God Committed to them, all other Nations being left without Law, without God, and without hope, in the world. Their perſonall and Actuall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that in reference to this holy Law of God they had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked exactly, kept it from their youth, and touching the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof were blameleſs; When contrarwiſe the Gentiles had walked inordinately, lawleſly after the inſtinct of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and luſts of their own hearts, ſervants to idols and devills, not to God. For this Cauſe they Contended that they by this their righteouſneſs had, that the Gentiles by means of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs had not right to the redemption and Juſtification which are by Chriſt. That the Gentiles in ſtead of the naturall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs before mentioned muſt become Proſelytes, and ſo the aſciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or adopted Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becoming <hi>Jewes,</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſeale of the Covenant Circumciſion in their fleſh; receive and be brought under the Law; and become perſonally righteous in keeping it; <hi>Elſe they could not be ſaved by Chriſt,</hi> Act. 15. 1, 24. Their bare Faith in Chriſt without their own righteouſneſs and works could not make them partakers of the tighteouſneſſe and ſalvation which are by Chriſt. And who ſeeth not here that Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> doctrine is one and the ſame in generall with theirs that were the firſt heretical troublers and ſubverters of the Church of Chriſt? But againſt this plea of the beleeving <hi>Jewes,</hi> the Apoſtle layeth his Contradictory Concluſion, That both the Circumciſion and the uncircumciſion, they that had and they that had not all or any of theſe kinds of righteouſneſs were made partakers of Juſtification through Chriſt, onely by Faith in him. That our own prejacent works and righteouſneſs are nothing to further, nor our former unrighteouſneſs and ſinn any thing to hinder our Juſtification, but Faith in Chriſt is all: <hi>He that beleeveth is not condemned, he that beleeveth not is already condemned,</hi> whether he be Jew or Gentile, clean or unclean outwardly; becauſe as he had ſaid before <hi>ver. 22, 23. There is no difference, For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> This Concluſion that Faith alone without our prejacent or concomitant works and righteouſneſs do make the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

By what means <hi>Abraham</hi> found and obteined the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification which is by Chriſt, by the ſame means all now obteine it that are Juſtified. But <hi>Abraham</hi> found or obteiaed it not by his own righteouſneſs or works, but by Faith. Therefore ſo do now all that are juſtified. The propoſition he leaves as ſtanding ſo firm on its own pillars that none will dare to ſeek the demoliſhing thereof. The aſſumption he proves in both its members, that it was not by his own righteouſnes: either Natural, <hi>i. e.</hi> derived from parents and anceſtors, <hi>for they were Idolaters and ſerved other Gods, Joſh.</hi> 24. 2. Or faederall in the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſenſe, <hi>for he was juſtified before he was circumciſed, and after received Circumciſion as a ſeal of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith,</hi> ver. 10, 11, of this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans:</hi> or Legal, For <hi>he was ſo Juſtified 400 years before the Law was given:</hi> Or perſonall by the works of righteouſneſs which he had done: For then firſt he ſhould <hi>have had matter of boaſting</hi> that he had done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards his own Juſtification, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And ſecondly, then <hi>his juſtification ſhould have been reckoned not of Grace but of debt,</hi> and ſo the glory thereof ſhould have redounded to <hi>Abraham</hi> and not to God, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And if by no one of theſe kinds of his own, then not at all by his own righteouſneſs. That it was by Faith he proves by clear Teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Therefore the concluſion ſtands that we are juſtified alſo by faith without works. That Faith and not any righteouſneſs of our own makes Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ours.</p>
                        <p>Another Argument he draws from clear and evident Scripture, witneſſing <hi>that the righteouſneſs and juſtification, which conſiſteth in the forgivenes, not imputing and covering of ſinn, is made ours without works,</hi> [therefore by Faith alone] <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
                        <p>When in theſe two Arguments none can deny but that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Juſtification which <hi>Abraham</hi> obteined, and which Conſiſted not in the doing, but in the imputing of righteouſneſs, and in the pardoning and not imputing of ſinn; is the Juſtification which is by Chriſt; and when the Apoſtle laboureth not at all to prove this to be <hi>The proper Righteouſneſs to Juſtification,</hi> but takes it as granted and unqueſtioned: all muſt acknowledge that his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was not, What righteouſneſs it is that Juſtifieth? whether Chriſts? or ours?

                        <p>Again, when the Apoſtle ſtill inſiſting upon the ſame ſubject, ſetts forth the priviledges of them that are juſtified by Faith, doth withall affirm <hi>that while they were yet ſinners, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I ſhall forbear to cite ſhort teſtimonies from other Epiſtles of the Apoſtle, evincing this Truth: and paſs to his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi> in which he wholly levelleth to this mark. It cannot be denyed by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> himſelfe that the Apoſtle there diſputeth not of a legal but Goſpel Juſtification, and that this is a Juſtification one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chriſt: that when he ſaith, <hi>If any man, if we, or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. his meaning is, not a Juſtification out of Chriſt (for this ſhould be a legal not a Goſpel Juſtification) but any other way to the Juſtification which is by Chriſt, <hi>ſave that which we have preached, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8, 9. Herein it was agreed between the Apoſtle and the falſe Apoſtles, that Chriſt is the alone Juſtifier, and that ſalvation is onely by him, and to this all the ſeduced ones among the <hi>Galathians</hi> aſſented.

If any demand the reaſon of this Conſequence, that whoſoever ſeeketh right to the Juſtification of Chriſt by his own works, makes himſelf an alien from Chriſt, from Grace; the Apoſtle in part implyeth it in that which he ſpeaketh in theſe 4 and 5 verſes of Chapter 5. But had more fully explained himſelf, Chap. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. So that by comparing together what he hath ſaid in both places, the reaſon of his Concluſion reſulteth into all mens view: <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a one ſeeketh the righteouſneſs and ſalvation which are by Chriſt, in a legall not an evangelicall way, by works and not by Faith,

                        <p n="6">6 <hi>Paul</hi> doth exclude all works under what name or notion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from juſtifying ſo as Faith juſtifieth, or to be inſtrumentall and conditionall to juſtification as Faith is.

And here I ſhall in the firſt place onely minde the reader of what hath been before Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly (in its place) manifeſted, that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> takes up this Feat of arguing from the Papiſts, who to Clear their doctrine of Merit and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:167891:348"/> Juſtification by works, from being derogatory to Chriſt and his Merits, do plead againſt us, That they in no wiſe leſſen the Merits of Chriſt, by teaching that good works do Merit and Juſtifie: But that herein they advance the Merits of Chriſt in aſcribing to them this ſoveraign vertue and power, to give validity and worth to mans good works to Merit and Juſtifie. Nay the Hereticks (ſay they) degrade the Merits of Chriſt, in teaching that mans works cannot Juſtifie or Merit, as if there were not force enough in Chriſts Merits to enable them to it. Whether theirs or Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have more ſhew of reaſon to ſupport it, I leave to the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reader to judge.</p>
                        <p>2 The whole Argument is Sophiſticall and fallacious: 1 In that his Argument is not full and wide to the proving of his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The poſition which by this Argument he pretends to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, is in his own words, that <hi>This doctrine</hi> [of his] <hi>is no whit dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> But his Argument is ſhapen one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove, that his doctrine doth not derogate from Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, not that it doth not derogate from Chriſt himſelf. Were it granted that it doth not derogate from Chriſts righteouſneſs, yet it follows not that it doth not derogate from Chriſt, any more than if a man ſhould aſcribe all due praiſes to Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> learning, but ſhould deny his honeſty, Charity, Chaſtity, verity, or other like vertue in him; yet becauſe he doth not derogate from the learning of the man, he doth not derogate from the man himſelf in any of his accompliſhments. Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> doctrine may derogate from Chriſt in veiling his grace, mercy, and fullnes in other Conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Compleating of his Mediatorſhip, though it did (where it doth not) aſcribe to his Righteouſneſs its due praiſe and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 2 In that he playes with equivocation of words: For to ſhun the deſerved hatred which the Papiſts doctrine incurreth from the Saints of Chriſt, he delivers their doctrine not in theirs but in the Arminian phraſe, putting under the name and in ſtead of [<hi>good works] Obedience to Chriſt:</hi> For this is an equivocall phraſe, and as oft as it is uſed in the New Teſtament in order to Juſtification, it is the ſame thing with Faith, and differs not a whit from it. <hi>The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith, obeying of the Goſpel, and obedience to Chriſt,</hi> ſignifying nothing elſe but the deniall of our ſelves and our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our truſting in Chriſt alone for Juſtification and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Chriſt and his Goſpel Command; in oppoſition to the voyce of the Law that [<hi>knowing nothing of Chriſt, ſpeaking nothing of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:167891:348"/> faith</hi>] ſaith, <hi>Doe and work that thou mayeſt be ſaved,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. But Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> takes this obedience to Chriſt not in that Goſpel but in this legall ſenſe, for the fulfilling of the Moral works which the Law requireth, to intereſſe us in the juſtification which is by Chriſt, and ſo deceives his reader with the homonymy of the phraſe. 3 In putting a reſtricting in his Argument, upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which in his poſition that he was to prove was left at large and in generall, <hi>Chriſt and HIS Righteouſneſs:</hi> but in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he putts a limitation upon it in the Major, <hi>That Righteouſneſs,</hi> which alſo he explaineth to be onely the <hi>Satisfactory Righteouſneſs, of Chriſt:</hi> as if there were no other but <hi>that righteouſneſs</hi> in Chriſt, &amp; whoſoever derogates not from it could not derogate at all from Chriſts righteouſneſs. I may ſubſcribe to the righteouſneſs of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> in ſome Acts of his, though I onely deſire but finde it not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Many other Acts of righteouſneſs were required in Chriſt (even as he is our Mediator) beſides that by which he gave ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Juſtice for our Sinns, without which his ſatisfactory righteouſneſs becomes unavaileable to us. And he that derogates not from the one, may derogate from the other. Yet ſee we the boldneſs of our Sophiſter, what he reſtreigneth in the propoſition about Chriſts righteouſneſs, in the Aſſumpeion he leaves indefinite, looſe, generall, and without reſtriction again, not [<hi>that</hi>] righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but [<hi>HIS</hi>] Righteouſneſs: ſo making his Argument, by his fallacy of four terms, to run four-footed. 4 By begging the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in Calling good works (which with him is the ſame with <hi>Obedience to Chriſt) the Condition of the New Covenant and Juſtification by Chriſt.</hi> Well doth he put it upon himſelf, ſaying, <hi>He that maketh them ſuch,</hi> for neither God nor Chtiſt ever made them ſuch. 5 His Activity and Liegerdemain, which he uſeth to draw off his reader from Conſidering the palpable ſophiſtry uſed in this Argument. This he ſeeks to do by giving and proſecuting in the explication of this <hi>Theſis,</hi> a ſeeming reaſon that he bringeth to prove his aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt came not to fullfill the Goſpel but the Law,</hi> and then ſpending his whole explication about it. When (not to ſpeak how equivocall and ambiguous the phraſe is, and in its moſt literal and grammatical ſenſe the aſſertion altogether falſe) we utterly deny, either that Chriſt hath fulfilled the works of the Law or the Goſpel in our ſtead, otherwiſe than by giving ſatisfaction by his death for our infirm and maimed fulfilling of them; or that works done to juſtifie us are as all works of the Goſpel, but are contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:167891:349"/> wiſe wholly works of the Law; or that Chriſt hath any more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our infirmities in fullfilling the works of the Law than of the Goſpel, in that ſenſe in which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> diſtinguiſheth them. It was his part not to ſay but to prove ſoundly his aſſertion, if he would not have it exploded for a new and vain fancy, rather than to have anſwered in his explication, objections of his own making that ſcarce touch upon the matter in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>This might ſuffice as a full anſwer to his Argument, to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it in ſo many particulars to be unargumentall, no argument, or a faulty argument, not a Syllogiſm but a Para-logiſm. Yea not to leave an occaſion to any of excepting that the propoſitions of the ſyllogiſm may have ſome force in them or either of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from other, to his purpoſe; I ſhall afford the labour to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them alſo.</p>
                        <p>To the Conſequent of the Major I have many things to ſay. 1 That it is (as the whole Argument) ſophiſtical, a meer declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of not a ſpeaking to the queſtion; The word [<hi>in that</hi>] is foyſted in beſides the queſtion, and makes that which is ſaid unſaid, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together beſides the queſtion. That which he undertakes to prove, is (in his own words) that <hi>His doctrine is no whit derogatory from Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> To prove this ſee how groſſly he acts the Sophiſter to be gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>le fools, in ſtead of a Logician to ſatisfie the intelligent. He that aſcribeth (ſaith he) [<hi>to works or] obedience, no part of that work which belongeth to Chriſts ſatisfactory Righteouſneſs, doth not derogate [in that] from that Righteouſneſs.</hi> No leſs true than the Goſpel, but ſo farr from the queſtion as the earth is from heaven. For who ever queſtioned whether the not aſcribing to works that which belongeth to Chriſts ſatisfactory righteouſneſs, be a deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting feom that righteouſneſs? Yea it were madneſs in any to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. For if the not aſcribing ſhould ſo derogate, then God, Chriſt, Spirit, Word, Apoſtles, Prophets, all Proteſtants, yea all animate and inanimate Creatures without underſtanding, ſhould be guilty of derogating from Chriſts ſatisfactory righteouſneſs. For none of theſe aſcribe to works any part of that work which belongeth to that righteouſneſs of Chriſt. How palpable is this cheat which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> would put upon us? He that doth not aſcribe &amp;c. doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate <hi>in that,</hi> i. e. in his not aſcribing to mans works what belongs to Chriſt, from Chriſt. By the like Argumentation might <hi>Joah</hi> clear himſelf from the guilt of murther Committed upon two bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men than himſelf; and Chriſts Tormentors themſelves from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:167891:349"/> any hand in his death: Thus might they learn of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> to plead; They that wound not, that keep a mans head from wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do not <hi>in that</hi> take away his life. True, the not wounding of the head was not prejudiciall to the life of them whom they ſlew. But the wounding and piercing of their bodies and ſhedding out their bowells, made them as actually murtherers, as if they had alſo daſhed out the brains of them whom they ſlew. It was not what they did not, but what they did that Conſtituted them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of murther. So it is not Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> not aſcribing but his aſcribing to works that derogates from Chriſt. Shall we thinke that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſlumbered and doated into this fallacy? Is he a puny that he ſhould need to be taught how to expreſs himſelf in an argument? Nay all muſt ſee that he knows it to be a heterodox and deſperate Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he mainteineth, that no honeſt and holy means can pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar up; therefore tramples all ingenuity under-foot, running over it to fetch patronage from his Sophiſtry. And even herein bewraies the high thoughts that he hath of himſelf, that all his flies are Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and his groſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Or if we take his meaning thus, That his doctrine in making Works a Collaterall with Faith to Juſtification, (which he would ſay plainly if he meant not fraudulently, and had not his own judgement and Conſcience ſuggeſting to him the weakneſs &amp; falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſuch an aſſertion) becauſe it aſcribeth no part of the work of Chriſts ſatisfactory righteouſneſs to works, doth not derogate from Chriſt and his righteouſneſs: Then I deny both the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and Conſequence of the Propoſition. For 1 It derogates from him and it a full potency and efficacy to juſtifie any one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be animated and enlivened by our own works to do it, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it all feeble &amp; dead to produce its effect untill our obedience as its Concauſe gives life to it. And this is Contradictive to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, who aſſerteth the efficacy and actuall effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs to juſtifie us yet <hi>ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4. 5. yet without ſtrength [to work] <hi>yet ſinners, yet enemies,</hi> and ſo workers againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8, 9, 10. 2 It derogates from it its glory, in parting and dividing our Juſtification between his righteouſneſs &amp; our righteouſneſs; ſo aſcribing part of the praiſe to man which ought to be attributed full and entire to Chriſt. This alſo is contrary to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, that excludes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:167891:350"/> works under every notion from having to do in the buſineſs of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>to exclude Boaſting, leſt any man ſhould boaſt, or glory in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. &amp; 4. 2. Eph. 2. 9. <hi>But that He that glorieth may glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 29, 30, 31.</p>
                        <p>Nay it doth not onely derogate from, but totally deſtroy and nullifie the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as to us and our juſtification. For ſo firſt the Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect to you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. And to be juſtified by the Law, or by the works of the Law, are with the Apoſtle the ſame thing, as hath been oft ſhewed before. Yea to ſeek juſtification in any part or degree by the works or obedience which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth as a Condition of Juſtification, is to ſeek to be Juſtified by the Law. Works being the Condition of Juſtification by the Law and not by Grace. 2 Becauſe it obſtructeth the way of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Chriſt hath made and ſends poor ſouls to ſeek it in a way that is impervious, by which there can be no acceſs to Chriſt his righteouſneſs. For the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is given of free Love, pure grace, meer mercy; as a <hi>free Gift,</hi> Rom. 5. 15. <hi>Freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and received,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Without money and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1. He is the worſt Simoniak that ſeeks to buy this gift of the Holy Ghoſt for money, to make it his by his own Merit and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Whoſoever is admitted to it, ſuch a one is rejected from it: For <hi>Chriſt came to call not the Righteous but ſinners to repentance. The Publicans and Harlots enter when theſe are excluded.

Who will envie to him the fruit of his deſervings? This is Condemnation from the Tribunall of Juſtice where no fleſh can be juſtified; when they which [<hi>work not] but beleeve on him which Juſtifieth the ungodly, i. e.</hi> which bring Faith alone without works as Coadjutors to put them into the actuall and ſenſible poſſeſſion of the righteouſneſs which is by Chriſt; theſe even theſe alone ſhall be juſtified at the throne of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. Why? theſe ſeek it in the way where God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:167891:350"/> is preſent to give it: The other in a way wherein God never was, never will be preſent to beſtow it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly I deny the Aſſumption alſo. It is falſe that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (ſo as he doth it) Obedience or Works the condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt, doth not give them any part of the work of Chriſts righteouſneſs. For it belongeth to Chriſts righteouſneſs by it ſelf alone, and to Chriſt by his Mediatory righteouſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to perfect for ever the Juſtification and ſalvation of his redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. And that without any acceſſary help of their own righteouſneſs, <hi>John</hi> 13. 10. But Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſo parteth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification between Chriſts righteouſneſs and our righteouſneſſe, as that he makes them equally concurrent to our ſalvation and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying: That Chriſts Righteouſneſs without ours can no more profit us, than ours without Chriſts: yea makes Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wholly unprofitable to every man, till by the ſerving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of each man it be purchaſed and made uſefull to benefit him. And ſo by making the efficacy of it the fruit of our Merit, he diſ-robes it of its honour and ornament, derogating from it its all-ſufficiency by it ſelf to perfect us, that he may arrogate to our righteouſneſs what is ſtoln from his. But how farr this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his derogates both from the grace of God, and merits of Chriſt hath been oft diſcuſſed. After all that hee hath ſaid to the defacing of both, here he wipes his mouth, and ſaith it was never foul: and will have his Reader conclude, that when his face of Chriſt is ſpittled, yet if it be from Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> lips touched with a Cole from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> it is a bleſſing of him.</p>
                        <p>This one truth I acknowledg, implyed, though not expreſſed in this Argument of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> that he acknowledgeth himſelf to be the man that hath made obedience or works condition of the New Covenant, or of juſtification by Chriſt. In this I contradict him not. It is of mans, not of Gods making, it's a creature of his own, not created by God, at leaſt not by God aſſigned to this uſe and end. It being therefore not formed to his hand, but a graven i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the work of his own hand, we leave him (ſith he will do it) alone without us to perſiſt in worſhipping it.</p>

                        <p>HIS fifth endeavour is to vindicate his doctrine from being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Anti-Evangelicall: That although it hold Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers not only under the bondage, but alſo under the Curſe of the Law, in life and death till the day of Judgment, <hi>Theſ. 9. pa.</hi> 65. &amp; <hi>p.</hi> 73. and elſe-where oft: Though it makes works the condition of the New, as well as of the Old Covenant; though he maintains that <hi>Doe and Live,</hi> is the voyce of the Goſpel as well as of the Law, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 81.

It would be too long to ſet forth in his own words all the reaſons that ſcatteringly throughout this Book of his hee bringeth to prove a probability and likelihood of truth in this his Paradox. The ſum of it is this.</p>

For they are conditionally pardoned and juſtified [as he frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf] and ſo there is ſome ground of hope, to take off the extreamity of deſpair.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:167891:351"/> here, I refer the Reader. Only let him by the way conſider with me how fitly theſe gloſſes of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> do agree with many plain and evident Sriptures. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Br.</hi> from the rigour of the Curſe, not from the Curſe it ſelf, for it lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us ſtill: or from the Curſe, that it ſhall not follow us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after the world is ended; not but that untill the worlds end it ſhall torment us both dead and living. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walke not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>i. e.</hi> No condemnation in its full rigour, but condemnation unto, and the execution of the Curſe they muſt bear untill the day of judgment, and after that he knoweth not what will become of them. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe ſinns are covered,</hi> Rom. 4. 7. <hi>i. e.</hi> in part bleſſed, and in part curſed. <hi>The blood of Chriſt purgeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>i. e.</hi> from all ſin, not from all the curſe and vengeance due to any one of our ſins are we delivered. <hi>God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you all your ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> Eph. 4. 32.

The time paſt is put for a time to come, and a certain for an uncertain time. <hi>Heb. 10. 14.

And the ſincere covenanting of this obedience, or this ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience covenanted, muſt be thus conditioned, elſe it is not ſincere. 1 It muſt follow upon the knowledg of the Nature, ends, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant. 2 It muſt be done deliberately, and not in a fit of paſſion, or raſhly. 3 It muſt be done ſeriouſly, and not diſſemblingly, or ſlightly. 4 Freely and heartily, and not through meer conſtraint and fear. 5 Intirely, and with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to perform the [whole] Covenant, and not with reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giving themſelves to Chriſt by the halves, or reſerving a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to maintain their fleſhly intereſts. 6 It muſt be the taking and obeying of Chriſt alone, not joyning others in office with him, but renouncing all other happineſs, ſave what is by him, and all government and ſalvation from any, which is not in direct ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to him, <hi>Append.</hi> pa. 33. Theſe make up a ſincere and perfect obedience, a ſincere and perfect Goſpel-righteouſneſſ, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in reſpect of Evangelicall, though not of legall perfection. For ſincerity is our Goſpel perfection, being a conformity to the rule of perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> the New Covenant as it is a Covenant, a perfection of ſufficiency in order to its end, which is to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification, <hi>Aph.</hi> p. 132, 133. <hi>[Who now is there of all men that hath eyes in his elbows, but ſeeth diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:167891:352"/> a vaſt difference between the Laws and the Goſpels ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying by works. For it is juſtice which requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but Grace that requireth but ſincere obedience to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. Nay the Scriptures utterly deny the Goſpel to have to do with the Law in this voyce, <hi>Do, and Live,</hi> as I have before oft alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but of his Mercy he hath ſaved us, by Faith not of works.

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yea if works in any notion or conſideration be brought as coupled with Faith to promote Juſtification, the Scriptures affirm them to deſtroy the hope of Juſtification, and to repell the grace of Chriſt, by which the Beleevers are juſtified. <hi>If ye be circumciſed</hi> (which in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe there is, if yee bring but this one work to forward your Juſtification by Chriſt) <hi>ye are bound to keep the whole law; Chriſt is become of no effect, ye are faln from grace, and faln under the Curſe,</hi> Gal. 5. 3, 4. &amp; 3. 10.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And if works or obedience in Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> ſenſe (which is the doing of the moral Righteouſneſs that the Law commandeth) be not as much as adjuvant to Juſtification, then ſurely ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cannot be helpful, where obedience, yea perfect obedience is excluded. This is, and appears to be either an inſtinct, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> own brain, not a doctrine of the Scripture, for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:167891:353"/> which way ſhall we turn the leaves thereof to find it?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Yea, how rational, or how ridiculous this diſtinction or gloſs of Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> applyed to thoſe Scriptures which deny juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the obedience of works, I leave both to the ſeeing and the blind to judg. <hi>By the works of the law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith Mr. Br. by the perfect obedience of works, but by unperfect obedience, if ſincere, we may be juſtified. <hi>Not of works but of grace, i. e.</hi> not of works perfectly done, but of works unperfectly, yet ſincerely done: ſo grace and works may be made friends, that is, Gods grace and mans vain glory may kiſs each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as co-equal workers of mans juſtification. <hi>Not by works of Righteouſnes which we have done, but of his mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> which wee have done perfectly, but which we have done maimedly, yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. If ſome <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſhould hear ſuch a Commentary of Mr. Br. upon <hi>Paul,</hi> he would conclude ſure, <hi>that one of them is beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, much learning hath made him madd.</hi> Either <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had not wit or words to expreſs his own meaning, that in the whole bulk of his diſputes, denying unto our works and righteouſneſs indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, all operation to Juſtification, &amp; doth not as much as with a Parentheſis, in any place inform his Reader that he ſpeaks not of Goſpel, but of legall works, not of ſincere, but of perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that theſe are rejected from, thoſe neceſſarily required to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: Or Mr. Br. that without craving leave of <hi>Paul,</hi> by ſuch groſs diſtinetions goes about to make him unſay what he hath ſaid, and the world to believe, that in all what he wrote of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, hee meant to be underſtood on the contrary to what hee ſpeaketh.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If we bring works at all to procure juſtification by Chriſt, we do by evacuating the grace of God and merits of Chriſt to our ſelves, oblige &amp; put a bondage upon our ſelvet to fulfil the whole Law legally in its perfection, elſe can we never be juſtified, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide under the Curſe for ever. For <hi>he that worketh, requireth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as a debt in law, and not as a gift of grace;</hi> therefore, except his work be ſo perfect, as that it can in ſtrict juſtice ſave him, hee can never <hi>attain ſalvation,</hi> as by comparing together theſe Scriptures will be evident, <hi>viz.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Sophiſm to prove that his Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Works, doth not at all derogate from the Doctrine of Faith, examined, and found to be meer vanity.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BEcauſe the Scripture attributeth Juſtification to Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, and to Faith in oppoſition to works, excluding works and requiring Faith alone to apprehend the Righteouſneſſe which is by Chriſt, and denominating it the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. <hi>The Righteouſneſſe which is of Faith,</hi> Rom. 9. 30. &amp; 10. 6. in oppoſition <hi>to the Righteouſneſſe of works.</hi> He eaſily ſeeth that he ſhall be excepted againſt for his antiſcripturall doctrine in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faith and works Concomitants in the ſame kind of cauſality and procurement of Juſtification. Therefore he makes it his ſixth task to vindicate this his doctrine from all derogation from Faith, and from all unſcripturall confounding of Faith and works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To prove himſelf as innocent in this as in all the reſt, he brings theſe Reaſons.</p>

Witneſſe Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> who neither in his <hi>Theſis,</hi> nor in its Explication hath alledged one Scripture to make it good. Is <hi>Pythagoras</hi> come among us in a new body, ſpeaking nothing but Parables and Paradoxes, which vulgar capacities can no more comprehend then they can <hi>Plato's Idea's,</hi> or <hi>Democritus</hi> his <hi>Atomes?</hi> If ſo, it ſhall be needfull for him to injoin upon his Schollars (as he did of old) five years dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſilence: Els if the mouth of a very Aſſe ſhould be open, it would rebuke the madneſſe of the Prophet, for delivering things
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:167891:357"/> ſo contradictive to the word, to himſelf, and to reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 To the word and the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by it, who every where oppoſeth Faith and works, as to Juſtification, making them to exclude not to infer or imply either the other. By <hi>faith,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>not</hi> [at all] <hi>by works: not by works, therefore by faith alone.</hi> But this man puts them in a conjunction, makes Faith and works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Condition of our juſtification, from thence to conclude that Faith is the onely Condition, and juſtifieth alone. So much a greater Artiſt is Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> then the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo ambitious of the praiſe of wiſedome that he thinks himſelf to be but a vulgar idiot, if his wiſdom be not ſtretched Nine whole words by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, beyond and above the wiſedom of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Contradictive to himſelf. For <hi>Aph.</hi> p. 300. <hi>He denyeth that which he calleth an idle Concomitacny of works with Faith, that they onely ſtand by while Faith doth all, and concludes that they act together with faith in the ſame kind of cauſality to procure Juſtification,</hi> and ſo denyeth that we are juſtified by Faith onely. Here contrariwiſe he denyeth all ſuch co-working of works with Faith, but <hi>that faith may be ſaid to be the onely Condition, and to juſtifie onely.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 Contradictive to reaſon alſo, (and yet this next to [<hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] he ſeems to honour as the greateſt God) it muſt be to the Goats and ſheep of the mountains, not to Chriſts ſheep, to men that have reaſon, that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> muſt deliver this doctrine, <hi>That we are juſtified not by faith alone, but by works alſo, yet it ſtands nevertheles as a firm Maxim, faith is the onely condition, or juſtifieth alone.</hi> If the lips were ſhut and ſealed up, yet reaſon would uſe a ventriloquy, or force a way thorow the ears to reclaim againſt ſuch an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. If I ſhould ſo reaſon of Condemnation the contrary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, that when the blind lead the blind and both fall into the ditch, when ſeducers pervert thoſe that are made to be taken and deſtroyed, and ſo all utterly periſh and are damned; That tho all are damned, yet it is but the leader and ſeducer alone that is damned, he for all that he hath ſeduced, and they all but damned in him their principall and leader: Would not Mr. <hi>Br</hi> be one of the firſt that would cry out at ſuch an Arguing, as abſurd and not Logicall.</p>
                        <p>Yet becauſe he is a man made up of the very ſpirits of Reaſon, and brings his Reaſons that his Aſſertion agrees with right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon according to the tenor of the Goſpel: I ſhall produce two or three in ſteed of many Goſpel Scriptures, and lay by them his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:167891:357"/> to ſee how pertinently they will agree as a Commentary with the Text. The Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>Eph. 2. 8, 9. We are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Grace through faith, not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> Comments upon this Text thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Principally by Faith leaſt any man ſhould boaſt principally [of himſelf.] But not of works principally to exclude this principall boaſting, yet leſſe principally of works alſo that man may alſo boaſt leſſe principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly [of himſelf.] Or thus, according to his ſecond reaſon: Of Faith and not of works unreducible to Faith leſt any ſhould boaſt, yet of works alſo that by ſome relation or cognation are reducible to Faith, that of ſuch works we might boaſt. Shall we call this a hatchet or a Comment upon the Text. Which of theſe Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the more abſurd? Or as if in this latter that runs more ſmoothly then the former, we might not conclude ſo wiſely of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny morall vertue or duty: When we are ſaid to be juſtified by any or all good qualifications and works, we are ſaid to be juſtified by Mercy or Chaſtity or Wiſdom onely, becauſe all other vertues and works are reducible to this, by ſome one or other kind of relation or cognation.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Rom. 4. 16. It is of faith that it may be of grace,</hi> the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis whereof is given, <hi>ver. 4. Not of works that it might not be of debt.</hi> The Comment which Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> firſt reaſon gives to this Text is, Nay it is both of Faith and works, works are comprehended in Faith as the leſſe principall in the principall: So that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text is, that it is principally of Faith, that it may be principally of Grace, but leſſe principally of works that [at leaſt] leſs principally it may be of debt alſo. His ſecond reaſon thus Comments, It is of Faith, that is of Faith, and works reducible to Faith, that it may be of Grace, not of works unreducible to faith, (ſuch as are murther, witchcraft, Sodomy, blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that it may not be of debt.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Tit. 3. 5. Not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> i. e. ſaith Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> Not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by our works, but according to his mercy. Yet leſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by our works, and not according to his mercy. Or not by works of righteouſneſſe done by us that are not, but according to Gods mercy that is reducible to Faith. What elſe to make of it when he hath taught me, I may divulge. I might annex many Texts of the ſame nature, upon which theſe two reaſons of his ſet as Comments, will ſpeak out ſo much of ſenſe, as the Commentator

                           </gap>wered before, all that is compriſed in this Theſis, where I took occaſion to weigh every branch thereof, under the notion of his ſecond Argument which he brings to prove Juſtification by works. To it I refer the reader for fuller ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>B. 2</hi> That he doth not derogate from faith, in yoking works with it in the joynt procurement of juſtification; becauſe he doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to works an equall part with it in this office or buſineſſe: but makes faith the more principall, and works but the leſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part of the Condition: granting our firſt Juſtification to be chiefly by faith, and the ſecond Juſtification onely, by Obedience: and aſcribing the beginning or firſt point of Juſtification to faith alone, and but the continuance and conſummation thereof to works. <hi>Aphor. Theſ. 74. &amp; p. 302, 311, 312. And in many other parts of his Book.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>All this hath been fully and oft anſwered before. Here onely I ſhall intreat the reader to retein in mind what hath been before pointed at.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the Goſpel mentioneth not, knoweth not any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of a firſt and ſecond Juſtification by Chriſt, but ſpeaks onely of one juſtification. That this doubling of Juſtifications is but a juggling fancy of the Papiſts by them firſt created, and by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> licked into a finer mode and form, for the pillaring up of their Juſtification by works which hath no proppage from the word.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That according to Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> principles who caſeth both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one kind of cauſality, it cannot be diſcerned how [other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by bare and glozing words] any pre-eminence can be given ſo as duly to belong to Faith above and before works in this buſineſſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That even where and in what reſpects Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> gives a pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, it belongeth more properly to works then to Faith: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſummation and perfitting of Juſtification is ſo far more excellent then the beginning thereof, as that which is perfect, then that which is unperfect. And herein he equalizeth and in ſom phraſes ſeems to prefer works to Faith, in their operation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what is begun.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That the Scripture affirms not onely the firſt but alſo the laſt point and period, the conſummation as well as the beginning of Juſtification to be by Faith. <hi>By the Goſpel the righteouſneſſe of God (viz.</hi> which he giveth us to Juſtification) <hi>is revealed from Faith to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:167891:358"/> Faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; he ſaith not from Faith to works, but from Faith to Faith, that is (omitting other Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions partly ridiculous, and partly invalid and beſides the ſcope of the Apoſtle) from Faith inchoat to Faith growing and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, or coming neerer and neerer to conſummation. This Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the choiceſt of our Divines give, as both properly agreeing with the drift of the Text, and as owned and patronized by the like phraſe in other Scriptures: <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 88. 7. <hi>From glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. which even all acknowledge to be underſtood, from one to another, from a leſſer to a greater degree of ſtrength and glory. So alſo of this phraſe, <hi>from faith to faith.</hi> And thus not onely the beginning but alſo the increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of Goſpel Juſtification in our own Conſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nces before God, is here attributed to Faith, which as it groweth to more and more ſtrength, by apprehending more and more revelations of the Goſpel; ſo it more and more declareth and evidenceth to the ſoul the certainty of our Juſtification, to the continuall ſtabliſhment and increaſe of our peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. And thus the <hi>Magis</hi> and <hi>Minus</hi> is in us not in God; and whatſoever of increaſe there is, is from Faith not from works. Nay the ſame Apoſtle tels us it is a moſt unglorious task which this uncomparably wiſe and profound man undertakes, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach them that are wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to become fools thereunto. <hi>Are yee ſo fooliſh?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having begun in the Spirit, are yee now made perfect by the Fleſh?</hi> That by the Spirit and the Fleſh is to be underſtood Faith and works in order to Juſtification, cannot, will not be denyed. When therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> teacheth men to ſeek the beginning of Juſtification by faith, and the perfecting thereof not by Faith onely but by works alſo, he teacheth them to be fooliſh [<hi>O fooliſh</hi>] the worſt fools to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to be wiſe onely to condemnation. This is to be wiſe according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> wiſedom in this Tractate, that is wiſe after the Fleſh not after the Spirit, in ſeeking happineſs in the way of works which the wiſedom of the Fleſh teacheth, not in the way of Faith w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the wiſdom of the Spirit, the wiſedom of Chriſt &amp; his Goſpel revealeth. But all this, together with a plain and full diſcovery of the vanity of this evaſion, hath been in its due place before held out, which would be but a tyring of the Reader here again to be troubled with.</p>
                        <p>Onely the generall and chief thing which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> both here and elſwhere layeth as a foundation to his Juſtification by works,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:167891:359"/> it ſhall not be amiſſe briefly to examine here, for the prevention of deceit to his Reader, before I put a totall concluſion and period to what I have thought fit to except againſt this Work of his. If it prove ſandy and unſound, his great <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of Juſtification by works, falls all to ſhivers. This is his quaint interpretation of [<hi>faith</hi>] in all ſuch Scriptures as aſcribe to Faith (in oppoſition to works) our juſtification. That then by it we are to underſtand all Goſpel duties, all that Chriſt Commandeth; not Faith in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration from other qualifications and duties, but Faith in a collective ſenſe, comprizing all morall duties and actions within it, which is Faith and all its fruits, yea more, Faith and all that is reducible to it. And thus according to Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſo oft as we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith not by works, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Holy Ghoſt meaneth, that we are juſtified by Faith and works done after the tenor of the Goſpel, not by Faith and works done after the tenor of the Law. Behold now the unfatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med depth of Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> wit, and the unlimitted verge of his power. His wit ſurpaſſing all the wiſedom of all good and Orthodox men and Angels; of whom no one had ever the reach ſince the world began, to find with all his ſearching ſuch a bugbear ſenſe lurking in the plain Scripture Texts of the Apoſtle: His power, that with the ſtroking of this <hi>Mercuriall rod,</hi> he makes fire and water, life and death, hell and heaven, to lay down all their enmity each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſweetly to coll lodge and incorporate together. Who would have thought that <hi>Paul</hi> who ſo ſeriouſly and ſacredly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth <hi>that he had rather in the Church to ſpeak five words with his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo that he might teach and edifie others alſo, than ten thouſand in an [unknown] Tongue,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 17, 19. And in preaching the Goſpel <hi>diſcended to the unlearned and babes to feed them with milke, to make all plain and eaſie to their underſtandings,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 2. ſhould yet every where deliver the chief doctrine of the Goſpel [Juſtification by Chriſt] in ſo dark Parables and riddles, that none could find it out, untill this <hi>Oedipus</hi> inſpired from <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> roſe up to un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>iddle him? For let there be named any one Proteſtant in any age (till Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> held out his Candle to give light to the Sun) that ever could dream of this Allegoricall ſenſe, after the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Origen,</hi> lurking in <hi>Pauls</hi> words? Or what hinders now but Faith may be turned into works and works into Faith, Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrict juſtice and ſtrict juſtice into free Grace, the Law into Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and the Goſpel into meer Law; ſince Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:167891:359"/> and compoſure between Faith and Works in the point of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>But whether this interpretation of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be ſo firm as it is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and witty, hath been before examined, as elſwhere, ſo in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of his third Argument for Juſtification by works, drawn from his large definition of Faith which he giveth in his <hi>Theſis</hi> 70. Here onely I ſhall mention ſome phraſes or names by which Juſtifying Faith is deſcribed in Scriptures, and leave it to the judgment of every intelligent Reader, to determine whether works can properly or in any tolerable ſenſe be ſaid to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in faith as acting in the ſame kind of cauſality about ſuch acts as thoſe phraſes or names imply.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 As Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> himſelf in his ſhorter definition defineth faith, it is called our <hi>Receiving of Chriſt,</hi> Jo. 1. 12. and that not in that wide ſenſe which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> fancieth, but in that ſtrict ſenſe wherein <hi>Paul</hi> interprets it, <hi>viz.</hi> the receiving of Chriſt <hi>to be our Righteouſnes, or receiving abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteouſneſs by him,</hi> Rom. 5. 16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is called the <hi>directing of the eye, or looking to Chriſt yea to Chriſt lifted up</hi> [upon the Croſſ] <hi>for healing. Io.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>A coming to Chriſt for Life,</hi> Jo. 6. 37. &amp; 5. 40.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 <hi>The eating of his fleſh and drinking of his blood to everlaſting life,</hi> Jo. 6. 53-56.</p>

Yea and that in faith onely and not in works at all? for how can Charity, Chaſtity, Mercy, righteouſneſſe, and the ſeverall acts of theſe and other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, of which moſt have our Neighbour or Brother for their immediate Object, about which in acting they are occupant; be called the receiving, intuition of, and coming to Chriſt? the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fleſh and drinking his blood, or the putting on of him for righteouſneſſe? It would ſeem ſtrange to me that any man waking and not dreaming ſhould conclude ſuch works to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, and not the fruits of Juſtification and life by Chriſt. Or that when faith is deſcribed by theſe denominating phraſes, works alſo as couched in faith, ſhould contrary to their nature be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated.

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Concluſion of the whole Treatiſe, demonſtrating that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we with the Scriptures exclude works from Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet we include them as neceſſary to a Chriſtian life, and that no leſs ſeriouſly, and upon more ſpirituall grounds, than the Evill Workers that will be juſtified by them.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving ended (at preſent) with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I have for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all, ſomewhat to ſay that may have relation to the weak reader. It is a difficult thing to remove works from juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to expoſe our ſelves therein to the Cenſure of babiſh, ungoſpellized, and unſtabliſhed men, that we therein baniſh them alſo from the life and practice of a Chriſtian. When we teach that the <hi>righteouſneſs of the Goſpel is revealed from Faith to Faith: as it is written, the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> [not by works:] <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. And that <hi>no man is juſtified by the Law,</hi> i. e. by the ſtricteſt obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>Becauſe it is written, that the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11. <hi>That the inheritance is by Faith, not by works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Rom. 4. 1, 2. Eph. 2. 8, 9. <hi>That it is of Faith that it may be of Grace: and if it be of grace, then is it no more of works, elſe grace were no more Grace; But if it be of works, then is it no more of grace, otherwiſe works were no more works,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. <hi>&amp; 11. 6. That whoſoever ſeeketh juſtification and bleſſedneſs by works, worketh himſelf out of it,</hi> and ſhall never attaine it, becauſe <hi>they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works af the Law,</hi> Rom. 9. 31, 32. At the ſound of this doctrine the unſpiritual man excepteth, and fleſh and bloud ſwelleth murmuringly Crying out, What profit is it then to ſerve the Lord? Why ſhould I faſt, pray, give alms, ſhew mercy, ſtudy holines and purity, deny my ſelf the pleaſures of ſinn, any more, when all theſe have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>fficacy in them to juſtifie and ſave? It was the Clamor of men againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached the riches of grace abounding the more, by the abounding of Mans ſinns: <hi>We will therefore ſinn</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>that Grace may abound,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. <hi>And do evill that good may come,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. This doctrine of <hi>Faith makes voyd the Law,</hi> looſing us from all obligation to perform the holines and righteouſneſs which the Law requireth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. And (as Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> teacheth them further to reply againſt God) tendeth to drive obedience out of the world. For if it be denyed that man can
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:167891:361"/> merit happineſs by his own righteouſneſs, he will ceaſe to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and take the bitt in his teeth to run rebell. So deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion hath the Covenant of works yet ſtill in mans heart, that though he be inſufficient <hi>to do or to think as he ought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. yet he will have [<hi>Do and Live</hi>] to be the iſſue of <hi>Life and Death</hi> ſtill. And Mr. Br. teacheth them to ſtopp the hole of mans inſufficiency with this nayl (not of the Sanctuary but of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith) becauſe we cannot perform legall therefore Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall do the work, (as if work were not work, when the Title of Goſpel is written on it) and becauſe we cannot fullfill perfect, therefore ſincere obedience ſhall ſerve the Turn.</p>
                        <p>Hence is it that the Popiſh and Arminian doctrines wherewith this Book of Mr. Br. is fully fraughted, takes every where ſo plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with, and hath ſuch Compleat acceptance among the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude both of the learned and unlearned. It is a doctrine not above but agreeing with the principles of Nature and the naturall man: even the naturall Conſcience ſuggeſteth it to the unlearned, to ſeek for happineſs by their own righteouſneſs. And both that and the precepts of Moral Philoſophy alſo, together with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> inſtruct the learned to ſeek for the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the beſt felicity, all felicity in the way of vertue and vertuous performances. Here now when any comes to them in the name of Chriſt, holding forth to them the ſame doctrine, it kindles in them ſo ſwiftly as fire in towe, no need of the teaching of God, or renewing of the Spirit; Fleſh and bloud of it ſelf gives its ſuffrage to it. An eaſie task have theſe teachers to perſwade men and draw diſciples after them, and ſet them in an activeneſs and dexterity of practicing what they teach. It is eaſily learned to ſwimm ſwiftly with the ſtream, and to drop the Bowle down the hill. But to teach men to live by Faith, and yet to be fruitfull in good works too: Not to ſeek juſtification and life by their righteouſneſs, yet to be zealous of all righteouſnes and good works continually; <hi>hic labor hoc opus eſt.</hi> It is above the principles of Nature to apprehend it. He muſt ſwimm againſt the ſtream, and roll the Bowl againſt the Hill, walk after the Spirit and not after the Fleſh, that puts it effectually into practice.</p>
                        <p>Yet that our Doctrine doth not let looſe the reins to the fleſh, nor (howſoever carnall ſenſualliſts may abuſe it to their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) in the leaſt degree blunt the ſpirits of the ſpirituall man to well-doing, nor deny the both expediency and neceſſity of all good works in the life of a Chriſtian, is evident. 1 Becauſe although
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:167891:361"/> we exclude morall qualifications and works from officiating to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, yet we retein and include them in and unto ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our doctrine with Chriſts and his Apoſtles, holds forth the Lord Jeſus to every ſoul to be received both as a juſtifier and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier; declareth him to have deſcended from heaven both to juſtifie the ungodly, and to ſanctifie the juſtified. That he is made unto us of God, not onely <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>Sanctification</hi> alſo: To juſtifie us by an imputed and ſanctifie us by an inherent righteouſneſs: The one by the effuſion of his bloud, the other by the infuſion of his Spirit. That his office is not onely to ſatisfie juſtice for us that we may live, but alſo to new principle and create us, that we may live to God. Not onely to redeem us from all iniquity, but withall to purifie us [into] a peculiar people, zealous of good works. In whom both theſe works are not in good meaſure, neither of them is in any meaſure, effectually accompliſhed. That ſanctification is the purchaſe of Chriſts bloud, but the immediate effect of his Spirit; merited by his death, but Conferred and Communicated by his life as all power both in heaven and in earth is given into his hand, and <hi>as he is aſcended on high to give gifts to men.</hi> That both imputed and inherent righteouſnes as termined and actually exiſtent in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man, proceed from his union unto Chriſt. That Sanctification is as great and glorious a work as Juſtification, and our real as our relative holineſs and righteouſneſs: Neither could it be diſcerned ſo cleerly how we were quickened [in Law] &amp; raiſed from the dead, who were dead in ſinns and treſpaſſes, and ſo paſſed from death to life, from Condemnation to ſalvation, by the forgiveneſs of ſinn; were we not alſo quickened &amp; raiſed up from under the death and bondage of ſinn, no more to ſerve ſinn, but as alive from the dead, had our fruit [and living motions] to practicall holines and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. That as well our ſanctification as our Juſtification, is in Chriſt, and both from him derivable to us by Faith in him. That Faith is qualified by God to apprehend Chriſt both to purifie us by his bloud, and to ſanctifie us by his Spirit, and ſo becomes inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall both to Juſtification and ſanctification, yet by a twofold Act; as the Condemned Traytor extends one and the ſame hand to receive from his gracious Prince a pardon of his Treaſon, and a Commiſſion to be his vice-gerent in ſome Noble and magnificent office therein to ſerve his Prince, promote the welfare of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and make his own name and perſon famous and pretious in the eyes of all men, among whom his preſent vertuous behaviour
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:167891:362"/> and Noble atchievements may wipe off and bring to oblivion the ſtain of his former delinquency. That one (and the ſame a chief) end of our Juſtification by Chriſt is our ſanctification &amp; the fruits thereof, here inchoat and increaſing, hereafter Conſummate and perfected. <hi>Therefore are we delivered out of the hands of our enemies, that we may ſerve him without Fear in holineſs and righteouſneſs,</hi> Luk. 1. 74, 75. <hi>Therefore are we dead to and delivered from the Law, by the body of Chriſt, that we ſhould be married to another, even to him that is raiſed from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God, and ſerve not in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the letter, but in the Newneſs of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 7. 4, 6. <hi>Chriſt hath made us Kings and Prieſts, or a Royall Prieſthood unto God, to offer up living ſacrifices acceptable to God through him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5, 9. Rev. 1. 6. To our inſtalment therein are pre-required, the ſanctification of Conſecration, and the ſanctification of habitual righteouſneſs and holineſs infuſed into us and ſet in actual operation in us. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe is done chiefly by the ſacrificed bloud of Chriſt ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Conſcience, and the ſacred veſtiments of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs put on by Faith (as was typified primarily of Chriſt the High Prieſt, and ſecondarily of the Prieſthood of Saints under the kingdome of Chriſt, by the Conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonns, with the bloud of the Altar ſprinkled on them, and the putting on of holy veſtiments upon them, their own being Caſt off, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.) The latter Chiefly by the Spirit of Chriſt, in livening enabling and acting them to the work and worſhip for which they are Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated (and I know not but this may be alſo figured in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſts under the Law, by the Anoynting oyl in the ſame Chapter mentioned and uſed.) That differs but little from Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as termined to this its end: This differs not at all from ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification when it is taken in the ſenſe wherein the ſcriptures often, and our Divines ſtill uſe it, (when they diſtinguiſh between Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification) <hi>viz.</hi> in its active ſenſe, the inſpiration of the habits of holineſs and righteouſneſs, in its paſſive ſenſe, the ſame habits inſpired into the ſoul. Whoſoever wanteth either of theſe prerequiſits to this ſacred office, we grant him to be but a titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſt, a Mock-Saint. For without Conſecration to offer as a Prieſt ſpeaks him an uſurper: And to profeſs Prieſt and not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſpeaks him a rebell and revolter. We own no ſanctification by the Spirit of Chriſt, which hath not Juſtification by his bloud, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der going before it, nor any Juſtification or forgiveneſs by the death of Chriſt, which hath not ſanctification by his Spirit, in order of nature following it.</p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:167891:362"/>
                        <p>Thus we do not (as the Papiſts and Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> learning from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts object calumniouſly) exclude works from the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but aſſert them to be neceſſary to a Chriſtian life: ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that without them whoſoever is Capable of working, is no Chriſtian. Though we exclude them from Juſtification, yet we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them in ſanctification, their habits as parts in the whole, their acts or themſelves acted, as fruits thereof. Nay we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a good ſenſe ſome kind of Cauſality which they have to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, that is, to the increaſe of ſanctification. <hi>To him that hath, it ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundantly. Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant, thou haſt been faithfull in a little, I will make thee Ruler over much, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith our Saviour; <hi>Ask and ye ſhall have, ſeek and ye ſhall finde, knock and it ſhall be opened to you. The ground or earth which drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Rain which cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs [or fruit,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>is neer to a bleſſing. But that which bringeth forth bryars and thorns is rejected and neer to curſing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. with many other the like Teſtimonies of Scripture, which it would be ſuperfluous here to recite. How then do we in the leaſt meaſure blunt the edge of mens affections to good works, by teaching that they do not juſtifie, when we affirm them neceſſary to ſanctification? If Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſhould affirm that Bread and Wine and other Creatures appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mans nutriment, are not ordeined of God to Clothe him, or that his garments are not ordeined of God to Feed him; doth he therein miniſter to me juſt Cauſe to exclaym againſt him, that he fights againſt natural reaſon, perſwading men never more to eat, becauſe their meat is not appointed to Clothe them? or to walk naked becauſe he ſaith, their garments are not uſefull to nouriſh them? No more Cauſe hath Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> or the Papiſts to accuſe us that we baniſh good works from the life of a Chriſtian, by teaching that they are not uſefull or appropriated to juſtifie, but to ſanctifie very uſefull in all the particulars before-mentioned. How unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the frame of a Chriſtian ſpirit are theſe objectors? Either they do not experimentally know, or elſe do ſtifle within themſelves this knowledge, that a Chriſt-enjoying and Goſpelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſoul gaſpeth no leſs for deliverance from the bondage, than from the Condemnation of ſinn: delights ſo much in performing duty to Chriſt, as in receiving pardon from him; groanes ſo pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically under the body as ever he did under the guilt of ſinn: Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with equall vehemency of aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore whatſoever the Lord powrs upon him to ſanctification is received with ſo great joy in the Holy Ghoſt as that which is communicated to him to juſtification: and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be and expreſs himſelf wholly Chriſts, as well as to obtein Chriſt wholly his. As for Mr. <hi>Brs</hi> meerly Morall Men that will receive Chriſt neither to Juſtification nor to ſanctification, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own terms, purchaſing him by Fine and rent, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might be partly theirs and not wholly Chriſts; It is enough that Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hardens and ſubverts them in this their Moral mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wholly contradictive to the ſpirituallneſs and wiſdome of the Goſpel. We ſhall not be inſnared by all the nicities of his Arts and Chimicall extracts of the ſpirits of his ſpoyling Philoſophy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve our ſelves with him in the guilt of poyſoning ſo many ſouls, and turning their beſt righteouſneſs and devotion into ſinn, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to appropriate the ſame to ſuch an end as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the glory of Gods grace, and contrary to the minde and rule of the Goſpel. We have one Maſter which is Chriſt, his dictates expreſſed by him and his Apoſtles in the plainneſs and fooliſhneſs of their preaching are ſo ſacred and authoritative with us, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt labyrinthical mazes of ſophiſtry ſhall unwinde us, nor the extravagancies of the moſt luxuriating witts, nor the moſt Curious plauſibilities of humane reaſon ſhall (by Gods Grace) unreaſon us ſo from our ſelves, as to undiſciple us from him. Yea though we could not in ſome things give a ſatisfactory anſwer to the ſophiſticated reaſonings of theſe diſputers againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, yet ſhould we fit down as fools with Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles adoring the manifold wiſdome of God revealed in a myſtery, rather than be wiſe with theſe men to the world; knowing that the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men: And we ſeek wiſdome and happineſs from the mines of Chriſts Goſpel, not from the dry quarrie of mans literature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Though we reject it as an arrogant and preſumptuous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> in Common with the Papiſts teacheth, [That we are juſtified and ſaved by our good qualifications and works
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:167891:363"/> for our works, for the merit and worthineſſe of our good works] yet we teach and believe that they are (in reſpect of all that have age, ability, and time to perform them) neceſſary Conſequents of our Juſtification and Antecedents of our glorification. Let a man pretend what he will of Faith in Chriſt; yet if by Faith hee do not cleave firmly to him, to derive from him power to mortifie every ſinn, to perform all duty: if he can allow within himſelfe any known evill, or continue in the neglect of any known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without ſtriving to get the victory in the ſtrength of Chriſts Spirit, over every ſuch infirmity: wee take ſuch a man ſo farr from Chriſt, as Chriſt is from <hi>Belial,</hi> A branch in Chriſt not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fruit, which is appointed to be cut off and caſt into the fire, becauſe he was never in Chriſt otherwiſe but by a formall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, never had vitall union to him, or communion with him, by the ligatures of Faith and the Spirit. For ſanctification is an individual companion of Juſtification: And the office of Chriſt is to be the Author of both to all that believe. Otherwiſe the work of his Mediator-ſhip ſhould not be compleated in either one of theſe, and ſo he ſhould not be our Chriſt if a halfe Chriſt only to us. And Sanctification is ſtill begun and carried on towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection alſo (where there is time and meanes) in the kingdom of Grace, before its perfecting and ſwallowing up into glory, in the Kingdom of glory. No righteouſneſs and holineſs of man is begun in the next life: But there ſhall be the conſummation in power, of that which here was begun in truth, though it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured of, and languiſhed with much infirmity.</p>

But wee deny this to be all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-grace exhibited to us by Chriſt, and in and through him. We hold him forth as the Light of the world alſo, having all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedom and knowledg hid in him, <hi>Joh. 8. 12.
